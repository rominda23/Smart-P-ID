*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

**Smart Engineering Manager User Interface**

The **Smart Engineering Manager User Interface** consists of several parts; the **Menu Bar**, the **Main Toolbar**, the **Tree View**, and the **List View**. The **Menu Bar** contains pull-down command menus. ** **The** Main Toolbar** displays command buttons. ** **

The **Tree** **View** on the left displays the nodes (Site Server, Plant Structures, Hierarchy Templates and Plant Group Types) in a tree format. The **List** **View** on the right displays property data for the nodes in the selected branch in the tree.

**Note:**

- The commands in Smart Engineering Manager are node-specific, meaning that the availability of a command depends on which node in the **Tree** **View** or item in the **List** **View** you select.

**Menu Bar**

The **Menu Bar** contains menus. Each menu contains its own set of pull-down commands. The commands are your main source of interaction with the Smart Engineering Manager application.

**Note:**

- During certain operations, the system dims some of the commands. For example, if a command is not applicable at a certain selection that command is disabled until it is applicable. This feature has been applied to commands to clarify the user interface.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 19

*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

**Main Toolbar**

The **Main Toolbar** displays command buttons for some of the same pull-down commands in the menus. The command buttons provide a quick and visual way to execute commands in Smart Engineering Manager without searching through the menus.

**Tree View**

The Tree view displays plant structures, hierarchy templates and plant group types. At the base of the tree is the Site Server root. The Site Server root is created when the **Create Site Schema Wizard** completes**.**

**List View**

The **List** view displays property data for the children of the selected node in the tree.

You can sort the **List** view by clicking a column heading.

**Notes:**

- You can use the **Tools** > **Show Fields** command to control which properties appear in the **List** view and the order in which they appear.
- To enable the **Show Fields** command, select the **Site Server** node or a **Plant** node or a **Project** node.

**Show Fields Command**

The **Tools > Show Fields** command displays the Show Fields dialog box which allows you to specify which properties display in the **List** view and the order in which they appear. The **List** view columns are the properties of the items in the **Tree** view.

**Plant hierarchy** - Lists the items available for display in the **List** view. Select an item from this list to display its properties in the **Properties** list.

**Properties** - Lists all properties available for the selected item. Properties that that are checked will display in the **List** view in Smart Engineering Manager.

20 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

**Move Up** - Moves the selected property up in the list. The higher a property is in the list, the farther to the left the property appears in the **List** view.

**Move Down** - Moves the selected property down in the list. The lower a property is in the list, the farther to the right the property appears in the **List** view.

**Note:**

- **Show Fields** settings for the site server are stored in the SiteShowFields.cfg file in the Windows *user profile* folder. This file contains all **Show Fields** settings except for the plant hierarchy information, which is stored in the plant schema.

**Upgrade Site Command**

You can use the **Tools > Upgrade Site** command to update the site data dictionary version number to the latest version of the software.

**Default Settings Command**

Smart Engineering Manager allows you to predefine values for creating sites, plant structures, and associating the application using **Tools > Default Settings…**. ** **Using these default settings simplifies the creation process and allows you to use the same settings across sites and plants.

**Note:**

- The values specified on the **Default Settings** dialog box are used by default only if you turn on the **Tools > Use Default Settings** command.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 21

*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

**Site Server Root**

The **Site Server** node is the root directory for each site when opened in Smart Engineering Manager. A site is a logical unit of data that is normally used to model a collection of physical plants. Every plant within a site has a unique identity.

In Smart Engineering Manager, you access a site by opening the **smartplantv4.ini** file, which contains the database type, connection alias, and the schema information for the site and the site data dictionary. The site schema basically keeps track of the plants in the site.

**Note:**

- You can place this .ini file in any location on any workstation and share it out to other users. Therefore, a site server is simply any workstation where the **smartplantv4.ini** file is stored.

The three main root nodes are listed under the **Site Server** root: **1. Plant Structures**

**2. Hierarchy Templates**

**3. Plant Group Types**

**Notes:**

- The **Site Server** > **Plant Structures** node lists each plant structure and each plant structure contains its related **Plant Groups**, **Roles**, and **Applications**.

22 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

- The **Hierarchy Templates** and **Plant Group Types** nodes are available for use by members of the Site Administrators user access group.

**Important**

- While you can connect to only one site at a time, you can have more than one site on any given computer.

**Site Server Options**

The **Site Server Options** dialog box displays when you run Smart Engineering Manager for the first time, and will only display during future sessions when Smart Engineering Manager cannot find an active site server or the site connection information in the **smartplantv4.ini** is invalid.

**Create a new site** - Starts the New Site Server wizard, which steps you through creating the site server.

**Important**

- Before you can create a site server, you must create a database and the database must be started. Check the computer’s Services to verify the

database is running.

**Connect to an existing site** - Allows you to browse to the location of an existing smartplantv4.ini file.

**Restore site from backup** - Starts the Restore Site Server wizard.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 23

*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

**Plant Group Types Root**

The **Plant Group Types Root** displays the building blocks used to create plant breakdown structures (hierarchies). Eight plant group types are delivered by default.

You can also create custom plant group types.

**Hierarchy Templates Root**

The **Hierarchy Templates Root** shows the various hierarchy templates that can be used to generate the structure of a plant. A hierarchy is made up of a set of two or more plant group types (formerly called hierarchy items) that are arranged in a tree structure.

A hierarchy (also referred to as a Plant Breakdown Structure) is used as a template to create a plant structure and defines the available plant group items for a certain level of the tree. The hierarchy is essentially a set of rules that the plant structure must follow. For example, a plant structure using Hierarchy 1: Plant/Unit with the **Allow** **P&ID Drawings** option set on the Unit level allows you to create drawings only under a unit in that plant. Using this hierarchy, you can create a plant structure containing only one plant, then multiple units, and then multiple drawings under each unit.

**Important**

- Drawings are not allowed in the top-most root item in a hierarchy. Therefore, **Allow P&ID Drawings** is not available at the root item level in a hierarchy.

24 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

- If you use a hierarchy in which **Allow P&ID Drawings** is not turned on for at least one level, the plant cannot be used in Smart P&ID but can be used in Smart Electrical.
- The plant structure hierarchy does not reference the hierarchy template after the plant structure is created. Smart Engineering Manager writes a copy of the hierarchy template to the plant database when the new plant is created. This reduces the dependency on the site for the hierarchy definition and allows you to modify the hierarchy template independent of whether any plant structures used it during their creation.
- You cannot modify a plant structure hierarchy after the plant structure has been created.
- During plant structure creation, you can choose to use one of the default hierarchy templates or use a custom hierarchy that you have previously

defined. You cannot modify the selected hierarchy template during plant structure creation.

**Using Custom Hierarchies**

Integration supports custom hierarchies, as long as they contain a minimum of three levels. By default, the delivered SPEMdatamap.xml file is compatible with the standard Plant > Area > Unit hierarchy.

**Notes:**

- After registering, Smart Engineering Manager cannot retrieve the PBS

document if the plant and SmartPlant hierarchies are not compatible. To be compatible with the SmartPlant hierarchy, your plant hierarchy can contain less than or equal, but not more than the number of levels in the SmartPlant hierarchy.

- Smart Engineering Manager retrieves only the hierarchy levels it needs from the SmartPlant hierarchy. For example, if your plant hierarchy contains 4

levels and the SmartPlant hierarchy contains 8 levels, only the top 4 levels of the SmartPlant hierarchy are retrieved.

- All Smart Engineering Manager hierarchy item names (plant group names) below the plant (top level) must match the names in the SmartPlant

Foundation plant hierarchy that are at the same level. The names are case-sensitive and therefore the cases must also match. The plant names do not have to match.

- In addition to requiring a minimum of three-levels in hierarchies, Integration also requires that the names of hierarchy items cannot be changed after they are created and that the hierarchy structure cannot be modified after you create the project. For more information, see the SmartPlant Enterprise Installation and Setup Guide.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 25

*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

**Plant Structures Root**

The **Plant Structures** root contains all plants created in the site. Each plant structure represents the physical hierarchy, plant breakdown structure (PBS), of your plant.

Under each plant structure are its related Plant Groups, Roles, and Applications. Each plant structure is displayed as a

node in the **Plant Structures** root.

The following nodes display inside each plant in the **Plant Structures** root: **Plant Groups** - Displays the plant breakdown structure (physical hierarchy) of the plant.

**Roles** - Displays the user access roles defined for the plant.

**Applications** - Displays the applications associated with the plant.

**Plant Groups Node**

The **Plant Groups** node displays the plant breakdown structure itself. This node shows each item created in the plant structure and displays its attributes in the **List** view.

**Roles Node**

Smart Engineering Manager uses roles to define and maintain user privileges and rights at the plant structure level. The **Roles** node displays the roles defined for the plant structure.

**Note:**

- To see the roles currently defined for a plant, select the **Roles** node under the plant node in the **Tree** view

26 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

**Note:**

- Each role can be tied directly to a Windows user group. The name and description of the role is the name and description of the group.

Individual users are added to the user group, and then that group is

added as a role in Smart Engineering Manager.

**Role Templates**

Smart Engineering Manager provides role templates to help you easily create new roles. Because the most labor-intensive part of a role creation is setting the values for the rights, you can now create templates for specific roles and then use the templates multiple times. This feature is useful for defining a role template in one site and then reusing that same role template throughout all your sites.

Smart Engineering Manager delivers three role templates by default:

- **None** - Sets all access rights to **None**.
- **Read-Only** - Sets all access rights for the role to **Read-Only**.
- **Full Control** - Sets all access rights for the role to **Full Control**.

When you create a role template, the software creates the .rts file. The name of the template is the name you give this .rts file at creation. All role templates are stored in the folder specified during site creation.

**Notes:**

- Any role template files stored in a location other than the one specified during site creation will not appear in the **Template** list on the **New Roles** dialog box. You can modify the role template storage path using the **Site Properties** dialog box. To use a role template at another site, you can copy the the .rts file to the role template location for that site. Another way to easily reuse role templates is to have each site point to the same folder for all templates. This way any template created in one site would be available at the other sites.
- Site backups include role templates if the templates are stored in the **Role** **template location** specified on the **Site Properties** dialog box.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 27

*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

- Smart Engineering Manager does not allow you to interactively view the rights specified in a role template file. The only way to see the settings stored in a template is to create a role using that template and then examine the rights using the **Role Properties** dialog box.
- When creating a role, the software does not remember the specific role template used to create the role. Thus, after you create a role using a specific template, you will not find that template listed in the role properties.

Furthermore, if you create a role using a role template and then modify the rights settings in that role, the template remains unchanged. In other words, the modifications you make to the rights are not automatically updated in the role template. You can, however, overwrite the existing role template with the modified rights settings by saving the current role as a template and specify the original role template file name.

- All templates are forward-compatible. If a right is no longer in the list of rights, this right is ignored. All rights that are added will be set to **None** by default, except for the default templates.

**Smart Engineering Manager Rights**

Smart Engineering Manager contains two sets of rights: Site Administrator Rights and Plant Structure Rights.

**Site Administrator Rights**

During site creation, you specified the group that you wanted to have site administrator privileges. **Site administrators** have a set of unique rights that cannot be granted to any other role. These rights include creating and modifying plant structures, roles, hierarchies, plant group types, enabling projects, and so forth.

**Notes:**

- The Site Administrators group does not appear in the **Roles** node in a plant structure.
- Only members of the user group specified as the Site Administrator User Group during site creation can see the **Hierarchy Templates** and **Plant** **Group Types** roots in the **Tree** view. Site administrators can see all plant structures and have full access to them.
- Site administrator privileges do not extend by default to full privileges in the engineering applications. That is, a member of the group granted site

administrator privileges does not automatically have full control privileges in Smart P&ID or Smart Electrical.

- Additional site administrators can be added to the Site Administrator User Group by using the administrative tools provided by Windows. Be sure that these users are granted network access rights to the computer where Smart Engineering Manager is installed.

28 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

- You can change the user group assigned as the site administrator group after site creation.
- You can automatically include the site administrators group in each plant you create by selecting the **Add the site administrator group to each plant** **created** option on the **Site Properties > General** tab. Selecting this option, will save you the step of creating a new role to grant these users access to the new plant’s Plant Structure Rights.

**Plant Structure and Smart P&ID Rights**

Users can have access privileges (rights) that vary from one plant to another in the same site. These rights are defined by categories. Each application, Smart Engineering Manager and Smart P&ID, have their own categories and rights. The Smart Engineering Manager rights pertain to plant structure and format access in general, and the Smart P&ID rights pertain to specific application access.

**Notes:**

- To view the user access rights, right-click on the Role and select **Properties**.
- The **Role Properties** dialog will display. Select the **Rights** TAB which details the categories and rights. On the Application pull-down menu, select the specific Smart application (Smart P&ID, Smart Electrical, or Smart

Engineering Manager).

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 29

*Intergraph Smart Engineering Manager Overview*

- The categories and rights are exposed through Smart Engineering Manager for controlling user access privileges on a per-plant basis for each application listed in the Application pull-down menu. If the Categories have radio button options, this indicates that the rights contained within are mutually exclusive; you can choose only one right in that category to apply to the role. In the other categories, you can choose multiple rights, as denoted by check boxes.

**Mutually-Exclusive Rights:**

**None** - The user is not allowed to execute the application or utility for this plant structure.

**Read-Only** - The user can execute the application or utility for this plant structure to view the data held within it.

**Modify Settings** - The user can execute the application or utility for this plant structure to view the data held within it and to modify any custom settings.

**Full Control** - The user can execute the application or utility for this plant structure and perform all commands and modifications.

**Notes:**

- These rights are valid only within the plant structure with which the right is associated. To access the plant structure through Smart Engineering Manager, the user must belong to a role that has at least read-only access to the plant structure.
- For examples for granting rights to common groups of users see the Smart Engineering Manager On-line Help or the *Smart Engineering Manager’s* *Users Guide* (~ *Program Installation Folder* \SmartPlant\Engineering Manager\bin\resdlls\0009\SEMUsersGuide.pdf). ** **

**Applications Node**

The **Applications** node displays the engineering applications (such as Smart P&ID or Smart Electrical) that are currently associated with your plant structure. Before you can use an application with your data, you must associate that application to the plant structure. For more information on this topic, please attend *Smart P&ID Setup and* *Customization Training.*

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 31

*Smart P&ID Overview*

**Smart P&ID Overview**

Smart P&ID provides multiple views of a central, unified data structure that represents the plant model. A view is a visual presentation of the data in the plant model and can be a schematic drawing or a table. The plant model is the computer representation of the conceptual design, including all plant components and their relationships. By manipulating model views, you can organize the information within the plant model to better understand and maintain the data.

**Smart P&ID Program Group**

Smart P&ID has several programs and utilities for visualizing and managing your plant data.

**Smart P&ID** provides the design environment for the P&ID.

**Drawing Manager** allows you to create and delete P&IDs and drawing versions, and print multiple drawings.

**Insulation Specification Manager** allows you to create and modify lookup tables for insulation specifications and thicknesses.

**Options Manager** defines plant-wide graphic standards for symbology, gapping, heat tracing, and formats. Options Manager also defines program settings and paths to the reference data.

**Programming Help** provides comprehensive information for customizing the software by using the Automation layer of the Smart P&ID

application. You should be familiar with Smart P&ID interactively and understand the basic concepts of programming before using Automation.

**Rule Manager** defines rules for placement and the copying of properties on symbol placement.

32 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Smart P&ID Overview*

**Smart P&ID User Interface**

The **Smart P&ID User Interface** consists of several parts; the **Menu Bar**, the **Main** **Toolbar**, the **Design Window** or Modeler, the default **Engineering Data Editor** **(EDE),**  the **Properties Window**, and the **Catalog Explorer**. Using the specific parts of the **Smart P&ID User Interface**, you can add, view and edit information for both the **active** and **non-active** drawings representing the plant model.

**Note:**

- The **Active** drawing(s) refers to the drawing(s) currently open and visible in the **Design Window**. **Non-active** drawings refer to all other drawings; every drawing except the one currently active.

The **Menu Bar** contains menus with pull-down commands. ** **The** Main Toolbar** displays command buttons. The **Design Window** consists of the** Drawing View** Window and the** Engineering Data Editor** Window which is opened using the **Window > New > Engineering Data Editor** Command**.**  Both the **Drawing View** and the **Engineering Data Editors** provide a way for you to view information in the database in two different ways; a graphical representation and a tabular format, respectively. They also provide a way for you to edit data for the drawings or plant model in the database. The **Catalog Explorer** displays all available catalog items for you to use in the drawings and plant model.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 33

*Smart P&ID Overview*

**Menu Bar**

The **Menu Bar** contains menus. Each menu contains its own set of pull-down commands. The commands are your main source of interaction with the Smart P&ID

application.

**Main Toolbar**

The **Main Toolbar** displays command buttons for some of the same pull-down commands in the menus. The command buttons provide a quick and visual way to execute commands in Smart P&ID without searching through the menus.

**Design Window / Modeler**

The **Design Window**, or **Modeler**, consists of the **Drawing View** and the **Engineering Data Editor**. Each of these views provides a way for you to enter information for the **active** drawing into the database. The two views also provide a way for you to view information in the database in different ways.

In the **Drawing View**, you can see the traditional diagram of a plant containing equipment, instrumentation, and piping in a graphical representation. You can create your drawing in the **Drawing** **View** using the vertical and horizontal scroll bars, and use the **Zoom** and **Pan** Commands to change the center point for the **Drawing** view.

The title bar identifies the drawing name.

The **Engineering Data Editor** allows you to see the same information in a tabular format, and it can also display items in the stockpiles (plant and drawing) and the other drawings (**non-active** drawings). The title bar identifies the drawing name.

34 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Smart P&ID Overview*

**Engineering Data Editor**

The **Engineering Data Editor (EDE)** uses a grid or tabular format to display and manage data for all objects in the plant and the stockpiles. The information displayed is based on query results from the database. You can view the same information as in the **Drawing View** or items in the plant and drawing stockpiles by specifying filters and layouts to define the table information. Then, you can input or edit the property values. The **Engineering Data Editor** displays drawing information in a table, much like the **Properties** **Window**.

**Note:**

- The standard **Engineering Data Editor** is displayed when you open a drawing and by default displays the data for items in the active drawing and Active Drawing Stockpile when you select an item type or a saved view. For convenient review and editing of plant data, you can open a standalone **EDE**

which displays the data in all drawings in the plant and in the Stockpile. The standalone **EDE** is available when no drawing is open in the Smart P&ID

Modeler.

- The **EDE** Scope buttons allow you to view items in the Active Drawing, Active Drawing Stockpile, Stockpile (Plant), or Other Drawings (**non-active** drawings).

**Properties Window**

When you select an item in a plant model, you can enter, view, and modify the properties associated with that item in the **Properties** window. Your system administrator can create custom properties and their default values for each property in the **Data Dictionary Manager.**

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 35

*Smart P&ID Overview*

The **Properties** Window is automatically displayed on the right side of the main window when you select **View > Toolbars > Properties**, select the **Properties** Button

from the Main Toolbar, or select **View > Display > Properties**.

The **Properties** window display is a two-column table that provides the common properties of the current selection in the active **Design** window. The active items always determine the content of the **Properties** window. You can only have one **Properties** window open. If only one component is selected, or all components are of the same type, all the properties of that type of component appear. If the select set contains components of different types, then only the common properties appear. If the selected items have different values for their common properties, the value box is blank.

You can modify the values for properties in the **Properties** window. You can display and edit relationships that involve components, component types, or assemblies.

At the top of the **Properties** window is the **Selected Items** list, which itemizes all the selected objects individually and as a select set. You can display item properties by locating the appropriate item in the **Selected Items** list, as well as by selecting an item in the **Design** window. If more than one item is selected in the **Design** window, then the **Selected Items** list contains the choice **Select Set** as well as individual items in the set.

36 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Smart P&ID Overview*

**Catalog Explorer Window**

**Catalog Explorer** is an interface to view and manipulate an electronic catalog containing drawing symbols and their associated properties. Conceptually, the **Catalog Explorer** resembles a manufacturer’s catalog with pictures of parts to build a plant. The paper catalog contains many items arranged in sections. **Catalog** **Explorer** replaces the paper catalog with an electronic equivalent. You can browse the catalog tree view for drawing items that you need or use the Search box to find items by typing a string. The **Catalog Explorer** include a **Favorites** section, **Quick** **Catalog**, and **Flags** (used to mark catalog items for searching) for easy navigation.

The **Catalog Explorer** Window is automatically displayed on the right side of the main window when you select **View > Toolbars > Catalog Explorer**, select the **Catalog Explorer** Button

from the Main Toolbar, or select **View > Display >**

**Catalog Explorer**.

**Catalog Explorer** consists of two main views: The **Tree** view and the **Icon/List** view. In the **Tree** view, you can open or close the nodes of the catalog file system by clicking the small right facing triangle icon to the left of the selected node in order to see or hide its contents. When a folder is selected in the **Tree** view, the **Icon** view or **List** view displays all the symbols in that folder and its sub-folders, organized by item class. From these views, you can select catalog items before placing them in a drawing or in a stockpile. The **Icon** view displays the catalog items as tiles, while the **List** view displays the catalog items in a grid.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 37

*Smart P&ID Overview*

**Status Bar**

The **Status Bar** displays at the bottom of the main window when a drawing is opened and if “Show status bar” is checked on **Tools > Options** dialog (General TAB). When you point at a command button on the toolbar, the description appears in the **Status** **Bar** at the bottom of the window. The first image below displays the **Status Bar** when you have pointed at the Zoom Area command button. Also, prompts that explain what to do at each step of the command, and messages about the operations the software is performing appear in the **Status Bar**. The second image below displays the **Status Bar** when you have selected a valve from the **Catalog Explorer** to place in the **Drawing View**.

**Dialog Boxes**

**Dialog Boxes** are another type of menu available and represent the most detailed method of interaction between you and the software application. The **Dialog Box** below is from the Edit > Replace command within the Smart P&ID environment.

*Smart P&ID Overview*

**Ribbons**

**Ribbons** help you control various settings for the active command and are commonly found within the Smart P&ID program. You can use the same ribbon for creating an item or modifying it. For example, if you place a pipe run or select an existing pipe run to modify it, the same ribbon is active. The options on a ribbon work like options on dialog boxes. Any options that you set affect the active command.

The Line Routing Ribbon below appears when you select a line element from the **Catalog Explorer** list view or the **Engineering Data Editor** or when you select an existing line in a drawing. You can dock the **Line Routing** ribbon in the main toolbar; it remains there for the current design session unless you move it again.

**ToolTips**

**ToolTips** help you find toolbar command names. When you point to a command button on the toolbar, a yellow label displays the command’s name.

*Introducing Drawing Manager*

**Introducing Drawing Manager**

To open **Drawing Manager**, select **Start > All Programs > Intergraph Smart** **P&ID > Drawing Manager**. **Drawing Manager** manages the drawing files in Smart P&ID. You do not modify the designs themselves in **Drawing Manager**, but you do create, open, delete drawings and modify drawing properties.

**Drawing Manager** is also the interface for printing multiple drawings and for upgrading drawings to the current version of Smart P&ID. The** Drawing Manager >** **Revisions** menu includes versioning tools for creating, comparing, and recovering deleted drawing versions.

**Drawing Manager User Interface**

The **Drawing Manager User Interface** consists of several areas (**Menu Bar**, the **Main Toolbar**, the **Tree View**, and the **List View**). The **Menu Bar** contains menus with pull-down commands. ** **The** Main Toolbar** displays command buttons. The **Tree** **View** on the left displays plant groups arranged in nodes. The **List** **View** on the right displays the list of drawings.

**Modifying the User Interface (View Menu)**

You can control the display of the **List** view using the **View** menu. You can add a filter so that only drawings that match specific criteria are displayed. You can display all drawings that reside under the selected node in the **Tree** view, and then customize what drawing properties are displayed and the order in which they are displayed in the **List** view.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 41

*Introducing Drawing Manager*

**Note:**

- You can drag-and-drop drawings from one plant group to another plant group, providing the drawings are in the same plant structure and the **Allow P&ID**

**Drawings** option has been enabled in Smart Engineering Manager.

**Filter Command**

The **Drawing Manager >View** > **Filter** command opens the **Filter** dialog box.

***Filter Dialog Box***

The **Filter** dialog box sets options for the display of drawings in the **List** view.

**Definition** - Displays all defined criteria associated with a filter. To add to or modify the definition list, you must select a line in the list and then define or edit the property in the **Edit** group.

- **Match all** - Specifies that items matching ALL the filtering criteria pass through the filter.
- **Match any** - (Default) Specifies that items matching any one or more of the filtering criteria pass through the filter.
- **Add** - Places a new entry at the end of the existing definition list and enables the options in the **Edit** group so that you can edit the new entry.
- **Delete** - Removes the selected criterion from the definition list. This button is available only when you select a criterion in the definition list.

42 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Introducing Drawing Manager*

**Edit** - Allows you to define or edit a single line of filter definition criteria.

- **Property** - Displays a list of all properties for a certain item type. Examples of properties include revision number and name. You define or modify filtering criteria by selecting a property, an operator, and a value.
- **Operator** - Specifies the relationship between the property and its value. These relationships include greater than, >; equal to, =; not equal to, <>; and so forth.
- **Value** - Lists appropriate values for the property specified in the **Property** list. If a list of attributes is not already associated with the **Value** box, you must choose null or type a value, which can be free text. You can type a percent sign, **%**, as a wildcard character to find multiple characters, or type a question mark, ** ? ** , as a wildcard character for a single character. Do not use an asterisk, , in the **Value** box.

**Notes:**

- Filter criteria are case-sensitive.
- View filters in Drawing Manager are strictly established only for the specific case at hand and are retained the next time you open Drawing Manager in the current plant.
- If you select a different plant, the filter is cleared.
- You cannot save individual filter settings.
- Click **View** > **Clear Filter** to remove an applied filter. If you have not applied a filter to the view, the **Clear Filter** command is not available.
- When using the **<** , **<>** , and **>**  operators in a filter item, null values are not included in the filtered results. To include null values, the operator **=** and the value **Null** must be added to the **Filter Definition**. For example, if all drawings that do not have a **Title Block Revision** value equal to **R1** are to be filtered, then the filter definition is set to **Match any** and the following criteria used in the **Filter Definition**:

Title Block Revision <> R1

Title Block Revision = Null.

**Clear Filter Command**

The **Drawing Manager >View** > **Clear Filter** command removes a filter from the view and displays all drawings.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 43

*Customizing the Sample Projects* in the *Smart P&ID Programmer’s Guide.*

- A multi-rep model item is created at the target only once if the drawings that contain all the representations for it are selected for copy in one session. If the drawings are copied in separate sessions, the model item is re-created at the target for that session.
- Paired OPCs in a drawing that are not copied (for example, not in a select set) are placed in the plant stockpile. Paired OPCs in a copied drawing have their relationships maintained by the copy. Paired OPCs are not moved from the plant stockpile to a drawing by a subsequent copy session.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 49

*Introducing Drawing Manager*

- A plant group item is created at the target only once if the drawings that contains all its members are selected for copy in one session. If the member drawings are copied in separate sessions, the plant item group is re-created at the target for each session.
- For copying/pasting of multiple drawings, the recreate process will begin after the paste action for all the drawings.

**Delete Command**

The **Edit > Delete** command allows you to delete drawings from the **List** view and from the plant structure. You must have the appropriate permissions, specified in Smart Engineering Manager, to delete a drawing.

**Delete a Drawing**

1. In the tree view, select the drawing that you want to delete.
2. Select **File > Delete**.
3. To confirm the drawing deletion, select **Yes** on the message box.
4. Select **View Log** on the **Deleting Drawings** dialog box to review notes from the drawing deletion process.

**Notes:**

- If you have a saved version of a deleted drawing, you can retrieve the drawing as it was when you saved it. *For more information, see Recover a Version of a* *Deleted Drawing.*
- If a plant group has no drawings or plant items belonging to it, you can delete that hierarchy item in Smart Engineering Manager. If you have associated a plant item with a hierarchy item by using the Properties window in Smart P&ID, it can look as if no drawings are associated with that plant group, and you cannot delete that hierarchy item in Smart Engineering Manager.
- You can also delete saved versions of a drawing, without deleting the drawing itself.

**Properties Command**

The **Edit > Properties** command opens the **Properties** dialog box, which displays the plant group properties or drawing properties based on the item selected in the **Tree** or **List** view.

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing**

**Environment**

Smart P&ID** **provides multiple views of a central, unified data structure that represents the plant model. A view is a visual presentation of the data that composes the plant model and can be a schematic drawing or a table. The plant model is the computer representation of the conceptual design in its entirety, including all plant components and their relationships. By manipulating model views, you can organize the information within the plant model to better understand and maintain the data.

Smart P&ID’s unique components work together to help make creating and modifying P&IDs an easy task. The Design Window supplies a schematic representation of the drawing. The **Stockpile** contains items that do not exist in the P&ID but exist in the model. The **Catalog Explorer** provides the items that you can insert in the drawing or model. The **Properties** window organizes the characteristics of the current select set in spreadsheet style. And toolbars contain shortcuts to the most commonly used commands.

As you work in Smart P&ID, you can set various options for each of these components to streamline your workflow. You can add buttons to toolbars, move toolbars, and customize various windows in Smart P&ID to meet your needs. These customization features allow you to have your favorite, most-used options available for immediate selection.

**Arranging the Workspace**

You can arrange the workspace in several ways:

- Move windows around on the screen.
- Display, hide, or customize toolbars using the Toolbars command on the View menu or the buttons on the main toolbar.
- Move toolbars by dragging them with your mouse.
- Move a ribbon to the top or bottom of the Drawing view.
- Set viewing options for the window by using the Tools > Options dialog box.

**Using the Window Menu**

On the **Window** menu, you can select a variety of commands for customizing the **Design Window**. Using these commands, you can create new windows for the **Drawing View** and the **Engineering Data Editor**. You can also cascade or tile these windows to navigate among them more easily.

54 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**New Menu**

The **Window > New** menu allows you to open a new **Drawing View** (**Window >** **New > Drawing**) or **Engineering Data Editor** (**Window > New > Engineering** **Data Editor**) window within the **Design Window**. You can open as many windows as needed to support a design. Each window has its own independent set of properties defining view range and display properties.

**Important**

- Creating a new **Drawing** view or **Engineering Data Editor** of a drawing does not create a new copy or version of the drawing. The same drawing data

simply displays in the different views.

**Drawing Command (Window > New Menu)**

The **Window > New > Drawing** command creates a new **Drawing View** within the active drawing. This command copies the contents of the active Drawing view into a new window and displays the contents as graphical items. The new view has the same filters as the previous Drawing view.

**Notes:**

- You can change the view features for the new **Drawing View** window using the commands on the View Menu.
- A new **Drawing View** is not the same as a new drawing. You must create new drawings using Smart P&ID Drawing Manager.
- You can have as many **Drawing Views** open for a drawing as needed.
- **Drawing Views** are named per the name of the drawing file. For example, the first drawing view created for the TestDrawing.pid file is named

TestDrawing.pid:1. Each subsequent Drawing View is assigned the next

consecutive number.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 55

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**Engineering Data Editor Command (Window > New Menu)**

The **Window > New > Engineering Data Editor** command opens the **Engineering** **Data Editor** in the **Design Window** and allows you to view and edit model data for a drawing in a tabular format. You can define one or more **Engineering Data Editors** for a drawing. The **Engineering Data Editor** displays drawing information in a table, much like a **Properties Window**. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, you can specify filters and layouts to define the table information and edit some item properties.

**Note:**

- If only the **Drawing View** is open when you select **Window > New >** **Engineering Data Editor**, the new **Engineering Data Editor** is opened on top of the **Drawing View**.

You can use the commands on the Window menu to rearrange the windows.

The image below shows the **Drawing View** and the **Engineering Data** **Editor** windows tiled vertically in the **Design Window**.

56 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**Cascade Command**

The **Window > Cascade** command allows you to overlap windows diagonally across in the **Design Window**.

**Tile Horizontally Command**

The **Window > Tile Horizontally** command allows you to arrange windows to fit horizontally in the **Design Window**. All the windows are placed an even distance from each other on the screen.

**Tile Vertically Command**

The **Window > Tile Vertically** command allows you to arrange windows to fit vertically in the **Design Window**. All the windows are placed an even distance from each other on the screen.

**Maximizing the Design Window**

You can maximize the **Design Window** to gain more workspace for your **Drawing** **View** by closing the default **Engineering Data Editor** Window, the **Properties** Window, and the **Catalog Explorer** Window. You can also resize these windows, stack them on top of each other, or undock them. Undocking the windows allows them to float, and then you can move them around on the screen as necessary. You can also close the unwanted toolbars or design a custom one that contains only the commands that you need.

**Note:**

- If you have dual-screen monitors, then you can undock the** **windows** **

**(Engineering Data Editor**, **Properties**, and **Catalog Explorer)** and move them to the other screen. This will dedicate the entire workspace between the main toolbar and the status bar to the **Design Window**.

**Using the View Menu**

On the **View** menu, you can select a variety of commands for zooming in and out on items in the **Drawing** view. You can also right-click anywhere in the **Drawing** view to access many of the following commands.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 57

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**Previous Command**

The **View** > **Previous** command** **restores a Drawing View.

**Notes:**

- To stop the repainting of items in the window, press **Esc**. This action is convenient for large drawings.
- To refresh the window, press **F5**.

**Apply Display Set Command**

The **View** > **Apply Display Set** command opens the **Apply Display Set** dialog box.

**Apply Display Set Dialog Box**

The **Apply Display Set** dialog box specifies which symbols display in the Drawing View. You can create filters that define which symbols you want to display. You can save these filters and share them with other users working in the same Plant. You can also define colors and widths for display items. If a display set is currently active, its name displays in the lower right-hand corner of the product.

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

color for any selected item(s). The default color square is defined with the crosshatch pattern.

**Width** - Displays the selected display width of items defined in the selected filter. A wider display width would cause the item to be more visible.

**Legend Box** – Selecting this checkbox prints a legend of the filters of a display set applied on the drawing(s)

**Notes:**

- For more information about filters, refer to the **Using** **Filters** topic.
- For a display set that contains one or more asking filters, on clicking **Apply**, the **Asking Filters** dialog box opens with the default values for each asking filter, allowing you to change the operators and values of each asking filter’s attributes, if desired. The attribute values you selected are used when saving or printing the drawing and those values are retained until the display set is cleared for that drawing. This applies on a per drawing basis; therefore, if the same display set is applied to more than one drawing, you can enter different attribute values for each asking filter and those values are retained

independently for each drawing.

**Display Set Legend**

Creates a legend for the filters in a display set when the Legend Box checkbox is selected in the Apply Display Set dialog box, when applying a display set to a drawing. The legend includes the colors, names and descriptions of the filters in a defined format.

From the Modeler or Drawing Manager, when you print a drawing that has a display set applied and the Legend Box selected, the legend is also printed. The criteria for printing the legend is defined in the Print dialog box.

**Notes:**

- If no display set is applied, then no legend is created.
- When the Legend Box checkbox is selected, the legend pops up every time you open the drawing until you clear the display set applied on it.

**Clear Display Set Command**

The **View** > **Clear Display Set** command removes the results displayed by selecting the Apply Display Set command. This command is only active if a Display Set has been applied to the drawing.

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**Find Redundant Breaks Command**

The **View** > **Find Redundant Breaks** command pens the **Find and Replace** dialog box on the **Find** tab with the **Find what** field displaying the entry **Redundant** **Breaks**. With this option, the software highlights break components, attribute breaks, and pipe segment breaks where those properties for which a discontinuity is expected are the same on either side of the break.

**Zoom Area Command**

The **View** > **Zoom Area** command allows you to zoom in on the Drawing view using the pointer to fence the area that you want to zoom in on. The selection then fills the view.

**Zoom In Command**

The **View** > **Zoom In** command allows you to zoom in on the Drawing view using the pointer. The selection then fills the view.

**Zoom Out Command**

The **View** > **Zoom Out** command allows you to zoom out from an area on the Drawing view using the pointer that reduces the display of items around a specified point in the active window.

**Fit Command**

The **View** > **Fit** command fits all visible items in the active view.

**Pan Command**

The **View** > **Pan** command allows you to move the display in any direction from a specific point in a drawing to see other areas of the drawing by dragging the pointer across the view.

**Show Grid Command**

The **View** > **Show Grid** command displays a grid so that you can place items with precision. The grid is not considered part of the drawing and does not print.

**Note:**

- You can change the grid display from static to dynamic by setting options on the **Grid** tab of the **View Properties** dialog box, which opens when you click **View > Properties**.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 61

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**Snap Grid Command**

The **View > Snap Grid** command aligns items with the grid. The grid is a set of lines in the drawing background that helps you align items. When you set the **Snap Grid** option, items always align with the grid lines or nearest intersection of the grid lines.

Grid lines do not print.

**Note:**

- You can change the grid display by setting options on the View > Properties > Grid tab. To view grid lines at a finer level, set the style to Dynamic and adjust the grid line width with the Density control.

**Show Inconsistencies**

The **View** > **Show Inconsistencies** command turns on or off the display of indicators that identify inconsistent relationships in the active view. When **View > Show** **Inconsistencies** is selected, inconsistent relationship indicators appear in the drawing.

If you do not want the inconsistencies to appear, click **View > Show Inconsistencies** again to clear the selection of the option.

**Note:**

- Also, you can right-click in an empty portion of the drawing to display a shortcut menu. Select **Show > Inconsistencies** to toggle the display of inconsistencies off and on.

**Display Command**

The **View** > **Display** command allows you to specify the windows, such as the **Catalog Explorer, Properties Window and Engineering Data Editor**; you want to see in your design session.

**Note:**

- Another method for displaying the **Catalog Explorer, Properties Window or** **Engineering Data Editor** window is to right-click the empty area in the main toolbar and then select from the shortcut menu.

**Toolbars Command**

The **View** > **Toolbars** command** **opens the** Toolbars** dialog box. This dialog box contains options for displaying, hiding, or changing toolbars.

62 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**Toolbars** - Lists the available toolbars. You can select the checkbox next to the toolbar that you want to display, hide, or change.

**Toolbar Name** - Displays the name of the toolbar that you have selected.

**New** - Accesses the **New Toolbar** dialog box.

**Customize** - Adds buttons to or removes buttons from built-in toolbars with the **Customize** dialog box.

**Reset** - Returns the toolbar to the state that it was in at the beginning of your current design session.

**Color Buttons** - Adds color to the toolbar buttons. Clearing this option causes toolbar buttons to appear in black and white.

**Large Buttons** - Enlarges toolbar buttons so that they are easier to see.

**Show ToolTips** - Displays on-screen descriptions of a toolbar button when the pointer pauses over one of them.

**Properties Command**

The **View > Properties** command opens the **View Properties** **Dialog Box** which controls the display of information in the Drawing view.

**Note:**

- You can access the **View Properties** dialog box by right-clicking in space in your drawing and selecting **Properties** from the shortcut menu.

**General Tab (View Properties Dialog Box)**

The **View** > **Properties > General** tab displays miscellaneous information about a Drawing view, including the view name, description, and view type.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 63

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**View name** - Allows you to name the Drawing view.

**Description** - Allows you to enter a description of the Drawing view.

**View type** - Displays the type of view. This information is read-only.

**Display Tab (View Properties Dialog Box)**

The **View** > **Properties > Display** tab controls the display of items in a Drawing view. Items that you can display include labels, drawing borders, grids, notes, and inconsistency indicators. When you select the check box, the display toggles on for that item.

64 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**Do not show labels for filtered items** - Prevents the display of labels in filtered views of the design.

**Notes:**

- This option is available only when the **Labels** check box is selected.
- This option only behaves as described above when, for the filter definition on the **Filter Properties** dialog box, the **Filter for** value is equal to **Label:** **Model Item**. If the **Filter for** value is equal to **Label: Catalog Item**, the behavior of each label follows the filter setting for the model item, including displaying and hiding, regardless of the setting for this option. ** **

**Show** - Lists options for objects you want to appear in your Drawing view.

- **Labels** - Toggles the display of all labels on or off, in any view. If the display of labels is turned off here, the ’**Do not show labels’** option is not available since all labels are no longer displayed regardless of the view tab that you are using.
- **Drawing borders** - Toggles the display of the drawing border on or off.
- **Grids** - Turns the grid display on or off.
- **Notes** - Turns the display of notes on or off. Notes can contain links to a file, for example, a Microsoft Word file.
- **Inconsistency indicators** - Turns the display of inconsistency indicators on or off.

**Select** - Includes other options for the selection of items in your drawing.

- **Prevent selection of inserted objects** - Makes inserted foreign data non-locatable in a drawing. For example, if you insert a file using **Edit > Insert Object** and do not want to accidentally select that file in the drawing, select this box. The inserted file appears gray in the drawing.
- **Retain Auxiliary Graphics colors** – This option is available only if **Prevent** **selection of inserted objects** is selected. If the drawing includes Auxiliary Graphics, selecting this option displays the Auxiliary Graphics in their original colors and prints them in those colors when printing the drawing. Choosing this option has no effect on other inserted objects. When this check box is cleared, Auxiliary Graphics appear as gray in the drawing and when printed.

**Grid Tab (View Properties Dialog Box)**

The **View** > **Properties > Grid** tab controls the behavior of the grid in the view.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 65

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**View** - Turns the grid display and grid snapping on or off. You do not have to display the grid to snap items to it.

- **Show grid** - Turns the grid display on or off.
- **Snap grid** - Turns the snap-to-grid feature on or off. When you select this option, items always align with the grid lines or nearest intersection of the grid lines. Grid lines are not printed.

**Style** - Specifies either **Static** or **Dynamic** grid style. A static grid displays solid grid lines that do not move as you zoom in or out. When you zoom in or out of the drawing, the grid lines for a dynamic grid change with the level of magnification. A dynamic grid displays index lines that intersect with the darker, solid grid lines. The choice of grid style affects the option that is available in the **Spacing** or **Density** box and the availability of the **Index** options, too.

- **Spacing** - Allows you to specify the space between the grid lines when you choose the **Static** grid style from the **Style** list.
- **Density** - Allows you to specify fine, medium, or coarse levels when you choose the **Dynamic** grid style from the **Style** list. For a dynamic grid display the number of index lines varies depending on the zoom level, and so you cannot change the **Index** list when using the **Dynamic** grid style.

**Index** - Specifies the grid index, which is the number of minor grid lines. This option is available only with the **Static** grid style.

**Inconsistency Indicators Tab (View Properties Dialog Box)**

The **View** > **Properties > Inconsistency Indicators** tab controls the display of inconsistency indicators, which signify the suitability of design work that you perform while creating the drawing. The software verifies in real-time if the composition of a drawing and the underlying data model satisfy rules defined in Rule Manager. Choose the indicators and severities that you want to view in your drawing.

66 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**X Errors above severity** - Turns the display of errors on or off. You can specify the severity level. For example, if you specify a severity level of five, all errors with severity of five or above appear. Errors are marked with a red **X**.

**Warnings above severity** - Turns the display of warnings on or off. Again, you can specify the severity level and control the warnings that you see. Warnings are marked with a blue **/** forward slash.

**Approved warnings** - Turns the display of approved warnings on or off.

Approved warnings are marked with green check mark.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 67

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**Using the Tools Menu**

**System Editing Command**

The **Tools > System Editing** command allows propagation of property values between related items. When **System Editing** is enabled for a plant, changed property values are automatically spread or propagated to related items per the currently defined consistency criteria. In certain cases, you may want to set a property value on one item only and not allow it to be propagated to any related items. The **System** **Editing** command (on the Tools menu and the toolbar) allows you to turn off the propagation functionality temporarily during a design session. After the change has been made, you can use this same command to turn it back on again. **System Editing** is always turned on when you start a new design session. ** System Editing** can be enabled or disabled for the entire plant by means of the Enable System Editing setting that is exposed through **Options Manager**.

**Note:**

- To enable system editing for a design session select **Tools > System Editing** or the System Editing button

on the Main Toolbar.

**Replace Mode Command**

The **Tools > Replace Mode** command controls whether catalog items are placed as substitutions for existing drawing items or placed normally. When this mode is active, the software places catalog items only when they replace an existing drawing item.

When this mode is not active, the software places catalog items as usual. The **Replace Mode** command will copy properties of the current item onto the new item.

The **Replace Mode** command works for like objects only. The item that you want to replace in the drawing must be of the same class: equipment class, instrument class, and so forth. For instance, you can replace a vessel with another vessel, but you cannot replace a vessel with a pump. The software also takes into consideration the connect points that are in use on the currently placed item. This stipulation means you 68 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

cannot replace an angled item for a straight item when the straight item is already connected at both ends. For example, you cannot replace a Flanged Nozzle with an Angle Parametric Nozzle if the nozzle is already connected to a pipe run, likewise for angled valves. **Replace Mode** also works on parametric symbols. Resizing is maintained during the replace if both symbols have an identical relative path.

The **Replace Mode** functions very much like **Edit > Replace**. However, the replace mode works for only one item at a time and is not activated from inside a dialog box.

**Notes:**

- You cannot use the **Replace Mode** for pipe runs or signal lines. If you need to replace pipe runs or signal lines, use the **Edit > Replace** command.
- With multiple representations, you can use Replace Mode **only if** Equip Class, Equip Subclass, and Equip Type are identical for the replaced and the new item.

**Replace an Item Using Replace Mode**

1. Select **Tools > Replace Mode** or select **Replace Mode** on the main toolbar.
2. In **Catalog Explorer**, select the item that you want to place in the drawing.
3. Move the selected catalog item over the drawing item that it is to replace.

**Notes:**

- The Replace Mode command works for like objects only. The item that

you want to replace in the drawing must be of the same class: equipment class, instrument class, and so forth. For instance, you can replace a vessel with another vessel, but you cannot replace a vessel with a pump.

- One exception is that the software ignores the instrument class when you replace instruments. The software does look at the value of the **Is Inline** property to prevent an inline instrument being replaced with an offline instrument. The software also maintains signal line connections if the connection points of the source and replacement instruments are of the

same type and have the same identification numbers and connection

angles.

- The software also takes into consideration the connect points that are in use on the currently placed item. This stipulation means you cannot

replace an angled item for a straight item when the straight item is already connected at both ends. For example, you cannot replace a Flanged Nozzle with an Angle Parametric Nozzle if the nozzle is already connected to a pipe run, likewise for angled valves.

- If the drawing item can be replaced with the catalog item, the replace icon is displayed, and the drawing item is selected.
1. When the replace icon

appears, click to replace the drawing item with the

selected catalog item.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 69

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

1. Continue to replace more items with your currently selected catalog item, or press **Esc** to quit placement mode.
2. Select **Tools > Replace Mode** again to turn **Replace Mode** off.

**Notes:**

- You cannot use the **Replace Mode** option to replace drawing items with items from the Engineering Data Editor.
- You cannot use the **Replace Mode** option for pipe runs or signal lines.
- The **Replace Mode** command also copies properties of the current item onto the new item. ** **

**Gapping Lines**

A gap in a drawing is a condition that exists when two lines intersect graphically in the drawing but not physically in the plant. To portray this condition, you can specify that lines show a gap at these non-physical intersections.

You can either turn auto-gapping on, and the software gaps your lines automatically as you route them, or you can choose when the software performs gapping on your drawing by using the **Gap Now** command. Using the **Gap Now** command, instead of turning on auto-gapping, can increase the efficiency of your design session.

Symbology and priority for your line gaps is set in Options Manager.

**AutoGap Command**

The **Tools** > **AutoGap** command turns automatic gapping on or off in the drawing.

When **AutoGap** is on, the software automatically gaps drawings during the working session each time that you modify an item, when you print, or when you save a file. A progress indicator at the bottom of the window alerts you to avoid selecting another command while the software completes the gapping. The **Gap Now** command does not affect the setting for **AutoGap**. When **AutoGap** is off, the software does not automatically gap drawings. By default, automatic gapping is off.

**Gap Now Command**

The **Tools** > **Gap Now** command will perform line gapping in your drawing at the time you select the command.

**Adding a Manual Gap to a Line**

1. Select the appropriate gap from the **Catalog Explorer**.

(**Symbols > Piping > Gaps** OR** Symbols > Instrumentation > Gaps**)** **

1. On the line, click the position for one side of the gap.

70 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

1. Then on the same line, click the position for the other side of the gap.

**Note:**

- Gaps are parametric symbols. You can resize the gap by dragging the

parametric handles.

**Batch Labeling**

The **Tools > Auto Labeling** command allows you to perform batch placement of labels on selected drawing items.

For a selection of items in the drawing sheet, labels are added for the appropriate items and a message displays showing the total number of labels placed on the drawing items.

**Note:**

- Only one label can be selected when assigning labels to the selected drawing items. The software does not allow you to make a multiple selection and therefore you must repeat this procedure for each label you want to assign.

**Compare and Refresh Command**

The **Tools > Compare and Refresh** command allows you to compare and refresh the active drawing with data from another version of the drawing.

The current drawing and the chosen version are displayed side by side and the differences will be marked in what is known as change groups. You will be able to refresh any or all the change groups.

**Update Symbology Command**

The** Tools > Update Symbology **command refreshes the graphic symbology of symbols in your drawing based on the current settings in Options Manager. You can force the software to redraw the graphic representation of your data, the drawing, by using the** Update Symbology** command.

The symbology and other settings defined in **Options** **Manager** usually only take effect in those drawings that are created after those values are defined. You can force changes in Options Manager to appear in the current drawing by updating Options Manager settings, regardless of when the drawing was created.

**Notes:**

- Any user can update drawings using these commands. However, check your permissions, which are assigned in Smart Engineering Manager, to find out if you can make changes to the plant-wide symbology in Options Manager.
- Once you load the current plant-wide definitions into your drawing, you cannot revert to previous definitions. However, you can always override plant-Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide 71

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

wide symbology choices in your drawing by using drawing filters and

choosing alternate symbology for items.

- The line width and color symbology for your active drawing is changed to the most recent symbology defined in Options Manager. You do not have to

update symbology for this drawing again, even if you end your design session, unless Options Manager symbology changes again.

- Redefining symbology in Options Manager usually only affects drawings created after the change. The **Update Symbology** command makes it possible to override this constraint.

**SmartSketch Settings Command**

The **Tools** > **SmartSketch** **Settings** command opens the SmartSketch Settings dialog box and allows you to choose what relationships are recognized by the software.

**Notes:**

- To activate the **Tools** > **SmartSketch** **Settings** command, you must be in Auxiliary Graphics mode. Select **Edit > Insert > Auxiliary Graphics** to enter Auxiliary Graphics mode, and then **File > Close Auxiliary Graphics** to exit Auxiliary Graphics mode.
- The relationships selected on the **SmartSketch** **Settings** dialog box are recognized as you draw within **Auxiliary** **Graphics** and **Smart P&ID**.

**Custom Commands**

The **Tools > Custom Commands** opens the **Custom Commands** dialog box. You can choose a macro and run it. Some macros are delivered with the software, generally in the ~ *Program Installation Folder*\SmartPlant\P&ID Workstation\bin folder. You can also record your own macros and store them wherever you want to.

**Customize Command**

The **Tools > Customize** command opens the **Customize** dialog box, which allows you to customize toolbars or menus to fit your workflow. You can add or remove commands on the toolbars or menus, or you can create new toolbars and menus.

**Colors Tab (Options Dialog Box)**

The **Tools** > **Options > Colors** tab** **allows you to select options for the background, highlight, selection, and handle colors in the drawing.

**Background** - Sets the default background color for all Drawing views in the active drawing.

**Highlight** - Sets the highlight color.

**Selected items** - Sets the color of selected items. The connect points in the drawing appear in this color, too.

**Handles** - Sets the color of handles when an item is selected.

**Use Defaults** - Sets all the colors listed above to the default display value.

**Note:**

- To set the symbology, (for example, the line weight and color) for item types throughout a plant structure, use Options Manager.

**Placement Tab (Options Dialog Box)**

The **Tools** > **Options > Placement** tab allows you to set the default construction status for the active drawing, and tolerances for locating items and moving around in the drawing.

78 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**Default construction status** - Assigns the selected construction status to all placed items. This list contains the following options: **New**, **Existing**, and **Future**. The plant administrator sets the plant-wide default at setup, but this option allows you to change the default on a drawing-by-drawing basis. The construction status for an item appears in the **Properties** window when the item is selected. Also, the construction status can be set for individual drawing items by changing its value in the **Properties** window.

**Locate** - Specifies the range, called the locate zone, at which a candidate item is highlighted when another item approaches. A candidate item is any item in the drawing that meets the placement rules of the approaching item. For example, a pipe run can be a candidate item, and a valve can be an approaching item to that pipe run.

The pipe is highlighted when the valve is within the locate tolerance. If you are not placing an item but only selecting drawing items, the locate tolerance defines how close that the pointer must approach to select the item.

**Break-away** - Sets the number of pixels at which an item disconnects from its parent item. For example, to move a valve, you drag the valve. If you keep the pointer within the break-away tolerance from the line, the valve does not disconnect from the line.

**Place partner OPC in Stockpile** - Specifies that when a new off-page connector (OPC) is placed, the partner OPC is automatically stored in the Plant Stockpile.

**Note:**

- If you clear this option, the **Set Stockpile Location of Partner OPC** dialog box appears after you place a new OPC. Using this dialog box, you can

indicate the drawing in which the partner OPC is stored until you place it in that drawing.

**Files Tab (Options Dialog Box)**

The **Tools** > **Options > Files** tab allows you to set options for inserting objects in the drawing. These settings take effect in your next drawing session.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 79

*Customizing the Smart P&ID Drawing Environment*

**Scale reference files** - Sets a scale option for inserting a reference file.

- **Coincident (1:1)** - Imports a reference file, also known as an inserted object, at full scale (1:1). This setting causes the reference file to appear temporarily in the lower left of the drawing and determines a drawing scale that fits the reference file within the drawing. The reference file is at the end of the pointer, ready to be placed in the drawing, much like a catalog item during placement mode.
- **Select Scale** - Sets the drawing scale to a standard ratio. The specified ratio defines the size of the drawing in relation to the size of the object. For a 2:1 ratio, the *2* represents the size of the drawing and the *1* represents the size of the object.

**Note:**

- The **Fit to Sheet** option in the** Select Scale** list determines a drawing sheet scale that fits the reference file within the sheet but allows you to specify where the file is inserted by clicking on the drawing sheet.
- **Custom Scale** - Sets the scale for a reference file that you insert. For example, when you type 3 and 2 in each of the respective boxes, the scale of the reference file is one and one half times its original size.

**My Reports** - Specifies the folder where your user-defined, or personal, report templates are stored.

- **Browse** - Opens the **Browse** dialog box, which allows you to select a local or network folder to store your user-defined reports and report templates.

80 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Using the Catalog Explorer*

**Using the Catalog Explorer**

**Catalog Explorer** is an interface to view and manipulate an electronic catalog containing drawing symbols and their associated properties. Conceptually, the **Catalog Explorer** resembles a manufacturer’s catalog with pictures of parts to build a plant. The paper catalog contains many items arranged in sections. **Catalog** **Explorer** replaces the paper catalog with an electronic equivalent. You can browse the catalog tree view for drawing items that you need or use the Search box to find items by typing a string. The **Catalog Explorer** include a **Favorites** section, **Quick** **Catalog**, and **Flags** (used to mark catalog items for searching) for easy navigation.

**Catalog Explorer** consists of two main views: The **Tree** view and the **Icon/List** view. In the **Tree** view, you can view the hierarchy of nodes of the catalog file system. To open or close a node, click the small right facing triangle icon to the left of the selected node. With a node selected in the tree view, the **Icon** view or **List** view displays all symbols within that folder and subfolders, organized by item class.

From the **Icon/List** view, you can select catalog items before placing them in a drawing or in a stockpile. The **Icon** view displays the catalog items as tiles, while the **List** view displays the catalog items in a grid.

The **Catalog Explorer** toolbar buttons located at the top of the tree view give users access to commands to navigate in the **Catalog Explorer**.

*Placing Equipment and Equipment Components*

**Placing Equipment and Equipment**

**Components**

You can place several types of equipment in your drawing, such as vessels, towers, boilers, heat exchangers, and reactors. You also place equipment components in drawings. Equipment components are items associated with pieces of equipment, such as nozzles and trays.

As you place equipment components, the software automatically creates a group relationship between the equipment and the component. As a group, the components move when you move the equipment. However, you can only associate an equipment component with a single piece of equipment. When you place an equipment component, the component is associated with the last selected or highlighted piece of equipment, creating an equipment group.

Depending on the rules defined for the equipment or equipment component, you can have limits to the possible placements for the equipment. For example, specific trays can be flagged for placement inside the piece of equipment, and nozzles can be flagged for placement outside the piece of equipment. Rule Manager defines rules that determine the way that model items interact during manipulation.

The software includes a standard group of equipment and equipment component symbols. However, you or your plant administrator can change and add to these symbols as needed for your plant.

**Note:**

- The software continually updates the database as you edit a drawing; however, the software does not update the drawing file until you save the file (when you click **File > Save** or when you exit the program). Occasionally, the software can end in an abnormal way, for example, due to a power outage. Thus, the database is up to date with changes that you posted to the drawing, but the drawing file reflects the status when you last saved the drawing. When you reopen the drawing, the software recognizes that the drawing file is different from the database and needs to be recreated. The following message is

displayed: “**One or more items in this drawing are inconsistent with the** **database**. Click **OK** to re-create the drawing from the database.”

94 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Placing Equipment and Equipment Components*

**Place Equipment**

1. In the **Catalog Explorer** icon / list view, select the equipment that you want to place.
2. Drag the item to the appropriate place in the drawing.
3. Position the item and release to place it.

**Notes:**

- In addition, you can click the item in the Catalog Explorer list view and then click the appropriate point in the drawing to place the item. Press Esc to quit placement mode. Or, you can escape placement mode by right-clicking.
- Placing items by drag and drop are not cyclical. Placing items by clicking to select and clicking to place are cyclical – that is, you will continue to be able to place the item until you right-click or click Esc.
1. In the **Properties** window, enter values for the equipment properties in the appropriate rows in the table.

**Parametric Symbols**

Parametric symbols have yellow handles that allow the item’s size and or shape to be changed. **Parametric handles** allow you to modify different parts of parametric items. Standard parametric handles represent up to four driving dimensions that have been applied to an item. Parametric handles can be in four standard positions: top center, bottom center, left center, and right center of the range of an item. You can scale the item parametrically by dragging any parametric handle. The software shows you the result of the operation dynamically so that you can be sure to scale the item correctly.

**Scalable Symbols**

Scalable symbols have **black handles** that allow the item’s size to be changed proportionally.

**Note:**

- An equipment item should not be defined as both Scalable and Parametric. ** **

2. Drag the equipment component to the equipment that you want it related to until the equipment highlights.
3. Position the equipment component and release to place it.

**Notes:**

- If you need to place an equipment component so that it is associated with equipment but not attached to it, you can do the following.
1. Attach the equipment component to the equipment that you want it related to.
2. Select the equipment component.
3. While holding down the **Alt** key, drag the equipment component an arbitrary distance away from the equipment.
- For internal placement of equipment components on equipment, you drag the equipment component to the interior of equipment and place it. For example, Flanged Nozzle-Internal, Nozzle-Internal, and Pump Nozzle-Internal can all be placed internally in a tank. If you want the nozzle opening facing to the right, approach the tank from the right when placing the nozzle. In other words, the opening of the nozzle will be placed in the direction that you approach the tank during placement.
- Components will have a placement style determined by Rule Manager. The default for trays is to place inside a piece of equipment while nozzles automatically place on the outside of the graphics.

*Routing Piping, Ducting and Signal Lines*

**Routing Piping, Ducting and Signal Lines**

The same basic procedures can be followed when you route or manipulate piping, ducting, or signal lines. After you select a line type from the **Catalog Explorer** list view, you can use the commands on the **Line Routing** ribbon to help construct or modify the line.

Lines consist of a series of line segments. The software places handles, represented by black squares or dots, at each segment vertex along the line route. You can use these vertex handles to move, reroute, or connect lines. You can add vertices to add segments to the line using the commands on the **Line Routing** ribbon.

The software also provides a shortcut menu associated with lines. Right-click a line and choose from several commands. You use this menu to break runs or join runs.

You can also use this menu to construct select sets of pipe runs. For more information, refer to *Smart P&ID User’s Guide topics: Line Connectivity or Auto* *Join*.

**Routing a Line**

1. From the List view in **Catalog Explorer**, select the type of line that you want to place. This displays the **Line Routing** ribbon and starts the line placement mode.

**Notes:**

- The **Line Routing** ribbon also** **appears when you select a line element from** Engineering Data Editor** or an existing line in a drawing.
- The **Line Routing** ribbon includes icons for four commands:

o The **Diagonal Mode (Alt)** command allows you to route lines in any direction and at any angle, instead of the usual constraint of

horizontal or vertical line routing. You can also press the **Alt** key while routing the line.

o The **Insert Segment Mode (Shift)**

- ***command helps to insert line

segments instead of routing new lines or moving existing lines.

o The **Break Run**

command allows you to break a pipe run. After

breaking the pipe run, you can enter or change the values for its

properties by selecting the pipe run and then selecting **Edit** > **Properties** from the menu bar.

o The **Join Runs**

command allows you to join two pipe runs.

- You can dock the **Line Routing** ribbon in the main toolbar; it will remain there for the current design session unless you move it again.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 99

*Routing Piping, Ducting and Signal Lines*

1. Click a connect point on an item in the drawing.

**Note:**

- You can click an empty point in the drawing to start the line, too.
1. Click to place the vertex at the next point in the line.
2. Continue clicking to place the vertices of the line in the drawing.
3. When the line is complete, right-click to confirm the placement.

**Note:**

- You can escape line placement mode by right-clicking two more times.
1. To put the line in the diagonal position, hold the **Alt** key, select the vertex, and move the line diagonally or in any direction.

---

**Notes:**

- Alternatively, you can click the **Diagonal Mode** **(Alt)** icon on the **Line** **Routing** ribbon to route the line at an angle and in any direction. ** **
- You can reroute or stretch the line by moving the vertex handle. ** **
- You can route signal lines in the same way as piping lines.

**Inserting a Line Segment into a Pipe Run**

1. In the drawing, select the pipe run into which you want to insert a segment.
2. On the **Line Routing** ribbon, click the **Insert Segment Mode (Shift)** icon**.**  A small icon similar to the** Insert Segment** **Mode (Shift)** icon is displayed next to the pipe run.

**Note:**

- Alternatively, you can hold the **Shift** key while moving a pipe run to insert segments.
1. Drag the selected pipe run to the new position.

4. Click to select the break point. *The software breaks the selected pipe run into two* *separate runs at the selected point between the two different colors. Breaking the* *pipe run allows you to define different properties for the two parts of a single pipe* *run.*
- 
    - 

**Joining Pipe Runs**

1. In the drawing, right-click the first pipe run that you want to join.
2. On the **Line Routing** ribbon, select **Join Runs**.
3. In the drawing, select the second pipe run to join the two runs.

**Notes:**

- You can change the properties of the new run by clicking the pipe run and modifying the values in the **Properties** window. If the **Properties** window is not open, right-click the line and then select the **Properties** command. ** **
- When a new pipe run is placed such that it connects to existing pipe runs at either end, those pipe runs are automatically joined together provided they have the same properties. Pipe runs are automatically joined together

whenever possible. Pipe runs always consist of a linear sequence of members and never include any branches. Placing a pipe run that branches off of an existing pipe run does not cause them to be joined together.

- When you join pipe runs with different property values, the property values are copied to the resulting pipe run based on the several factors. The next four scenarios present the factors that determine how property values are copied when pipe runs with different property values are joined together using the Join Runs command.

o If you join two pipe runs that were previously routed as a single pipe run and then broken into two pipe runs with different property values and both pipe runs have the same number of components, the resulting pipe run has the property values of the pipe run according to the routing (left to right or right to left). When routed Left to Right, property values on the left pipe *Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 101

*Routing Piping, Ducting and Signal Lines*

run are copied to right. When routed Right to Left, property values on the right are copied to the left.

o If you join two pipe runs that were previously routed as two separate pipe runs with different property values and both pipe runs have the same

number of components, the resulting pipe run has the property values of the pipe run according to the connectivity or the pulling together of the pipe runs prior to using the **Join Runs** command. When connected Left to Right, property values on the right pipe run are copied to left. When

connected Right to Left, property values on the left pipe run are copied to the right.

o If you join two pipe runs that were previously routed as a single pipe run and then broken into two pipe runs with different property values and both pipe runs have different number of components, the resulting pipe run has the property values of the pipe run with the greater number of

components. The property values are copied from the pipe run with the

greater number of components to the pipe run with the fewer number of

components regardless of the routing or joining of the pipe runs.

o If you join two pipe runs that were previously routed as two separate pipe runs with different property values and both pipe runs have different

number of components, the resulting pipe run has the property values of the pipe run with the greater number of components. The property values are copied from the pipe run with the greater number of components to the pipe run with the fewer number of components regardless of the routing, connectivity, or joining of the pipe runs.

**Heat Trace and Jacketed Heat Trace**

Heat tracing and jacketed heat tracing are intelligent properties of piping. The line style and type of the heat tracing is defined in **Options Manager**. You can define the heat trace symbology and if desired, you can specify whether a particular heat trace medium is defined as single heat trace, double heat trace, or jacketed heat trace. This affects the way the symbology is applied, as shown in the following examples:

- **Single Heat Trace** - The single heat trace medium is defined, and the symbology is displayed for the pipe run, valve, and nozzle.
- **Double Heat Trace** - The double heat trace medium is defined for the pipe run, valve, and nozzle. However, the double heat trace symbology is displayed for the pipe run only.

102 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Routing Piping, Ducting and Signal Lines*

- **Jacketed Heat Trace** - The jacketed heat trace medium is defined for the pipe run, valve, and nozzle. However, the jacketed heat trace symbology is displayed for the pipe run and valve only.

**Notes:**

- When a pipe is jacketed, there is no insulation on the pipe itself. The

“Insulation” properties in the Properties Window do not apply to this type of pipe.

- The jacketed line is not insulated, it is jacketed. The jacket, which has a different nominal diameter than the pipe, can be insulated and it can have an insulation nominal diameter and an insulation purpose. You would set these values in the “Piping Jacket” section of the Properties Window

(J_Insulation Nominal Diameter and J_Insulation Purpose). This section

appears in the Properties Window when you use a Jacketed Pipe Heat

Trace medium.

**Assigning Heat Tracing to an Item**

1. Select the pipe run, piping component, equipment, equipment component, nozzle, or instrument for which you want to specify heat tracing.
2. In the **Properties** window, specify values for the **Heat Trace Medium**, **Heat** **Trace Medium Temp**, and **Heat Trace Requirement** properties.

**Assigning Jacketed Heat Tracing to an Item**

1. Select the pipe run, piping component, equipment, equipment component, nozzle, or instrument that you want to specify as being jacketed.
2. In the **Properties** window, select a value for the **Heat Trace Medium** that is defined as jacketing.
3. Select values for the **Heat Trace Medium Temp** and **Heat Trace Requirement** properties.

Piping components are graphic elements that represent processes or functions within a piping segment. Piping components include valves, flanges, reducers, and strainers.

In drawings, piping components are connected by lines.

Generally, piping components automatically orient themselves when you drag them near an existing pipe segment. For example, if you drag a horizontal valve to a vertical pipe, the valve automatically orients itself vertically. If several possible orientations exist for the piping component, you can use the Configuration Tool, or QuickPick, to review the possible placements for the component and select a final orientation for the item. Rule Manager defines rules that determine the way that model items interact during manipulation.

As you place piping components, the software automatically creates a relationship between the pipe route and the component to create a pipe run. When you move the pipe run, the pipe route and the associated piping components both move. Your plant administrator can modify the relationships between piping components and piping in Rule Manager.

The software includes a standard group of piping component symbols. However, your plant administrator can change and add to these symbols in Catalog Manager as needed.

**Place a Piping Component**

1. In the **Catalog Explorer** list view, select the piping component that you want to place.
2. As you drag the piping component over a pipe run or the pointer passes over runs while you are in the placement mode, the pipe run is highlighted.
3. Position the piping component and release.

**Notes:**

- If you place a piping component when a pipe segment is not highlighted, the piping component is placed in free space if the placement rules in **Rule** **Manager** allow the action.
- You can enter values for the properties of the piping component in the **Properties** window.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 105

*Placing Piping Components*

- If you want to move a piping component but preserve its connection to the pipe run, you can use the **Alt** key as you drag the component. Then even if you drag the component away from the line, the line routes itself to preserve its connection to the component.
- If you want to be able to place two inline components an arbitrary distance apart, regardless of minimum distance settings in Options Manager, do the following.
1. Place the first component in the line.
2. Place the second component into the line and connect it to the connect point of the first component on the end that you want to attach to.

**Note:**

- If the components are already close to each other but not connected

at coincident connect points, you must drag one off the segment to

disconnect it and then move it back to get the connect points

attached.

1. While holding down the **Alt** key, drag one component along the line away from the other leaving the desired distance between the two.

**Configuration Tool (QuickPick)**

In addition to using the manipulation handles to orient an item after you place it, you can use **Configuration Tool** **(QuickPick)** to select the orientation of some items, such as check valves or flow arrows or other inline items, when you are placing them.

Pausing after you drag the item to the appropriate place in the drawing activates the **QuickPick**, if it is available for the selected item, and allows you to select the proper orientation for the item.

**Note:**

- **QuickPick** helps you to select items that overlap each other.

**Place an Item with the QuickPick**

1. Drag the piping component to the appropriate position on the line.
2. Pause until ellipses appear beside the pointer.
3. Click to display the **QuickPick**.

106 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Placing Piping Components*

1. Move the pointer over each numbered button to preview the available orientations.
2. When the appropriate orientation is displayed, click the corresponding button to place the item in that orientation.

**Select an Item Using the QuickPick**

1. Pause the pointer over the item that you want to select.
2. When the pointer appears with ellipses, click.
3. On the **QuickPick**, move the pointer over the numbered buttons, without clicking, to highlight the way the item will be placed when selected.
- Moving the pointer over button number one, the first item is highlighted.
- Moving the pointer over button number two, the second item is highlighted.
1. When the item that you want to select is highlighted, click the corresponding numbered button on the **QuickPick**.

**Placing Two Components (Valve and Reducer) End to End**

1. Drag the end of the Reducer over the Gate Valve until the **black handle** appears.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 109

*Placing Piping Components*

**Break Components**

Piping components, in-line instruments and nozzles can be defined in the catalog as break components. Defining a catalog item as a break component allows properties to be different on the two sides of that item, suppresses the consistency checking, and limits the propagation of the properties that are broken. For example, reducers break the nominal diameter property, and pressure relief devices break the pressure property. A component can break properties of the connected runs. When changing the Nominal Diameter in a pipeline, the spread of that change is limited by any reducers that exist in that pipeline. The consistency checking that would normally occur between the connected pipes is also suppressed at the reducer.

A break component can be created for any property or collection of properties of a pipe run. To create a break component, you must first create a special filter. This filter must apply to pipe runs and must include the properties to be broken as criteria in the filter. The value for each property in the filter is not important. The final step in creating a break component is to open the symbol in **Catalog Manager** and select the **Property Breaks** command to select the filter. When the resulting break component is placed into a drawing, it breaks the pipe run (or signal run) it is placed into. When a broken property value is changed on either side of the component, the break component limits the propagation of the changed value.

**Placing a Break Component**

1. From the **Catalog Explorer** List view, select the item that you want to place such as a reducer.
2. Click to place the break component, reducer, on the pipe run to the right of the gate valve.
3. Highlight the pipe run to the left of the gate valve.
4. In the **Properties** window, set the **Nominal Diameter** property to **2”** .

**Note:**

- Notice that all items on the left side of the reducer are highlighted thus limiting the propagation of the **Nominal Diameter** property value past the reducer.

*Placing Piping Components*

**Using Off-Page and Utility Connectors**

**Off-Page and Utility Connectors** graphically represent the continuance of a line from one drawing to another. A connector is not actually a label but more like a component that includes a label. Placement behavior for a connector is like a standard piping component label. OPCs, utility connectors, and piping components can be inserted into a line.

The drawing needs a connector when a line run continues to another drawing. The minimum information in the label portion is the drawing name to which the connector points and the connector number. Connectors do not have a property for flow direction, although most connectors use an arrowhead to indicate direction. When you place a connector, it does not set or respond to flow direction. The connector represents continuation; not flow.

When you place a connector in a drawing, the property for the drawing name is not defined. The partner in the stockpile reflects the drawing name in which its match was located. When you place the partner from the stockpile, the first connector is updated to reflect the drawing name where you placed the partner connector. Thus, you never need to type a drawing name, and the software guarantees a valid match.

In **Catalog Explorer**, for process lines, there are two types of connectors available; Off-Drawing or Off-Unit OPCs, and Utility Connectors. The correct symbology differentiates OPCs.

**Notes:**

- The outline of the connector label is invisible, and only becomes visible when you approach or pause over the connector.
- To move the connector, you must select the connector itself and not the label.

To select the connector, approach it from the end. The connector will

highlight and then you can select and reposition it.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 111

*Placing Piping Components*

- You cannot change the drawing name in the labels; this value is automatically assigned by the software. However, you can change other properties.
- If you copy a connector, the software must generate new connector numbers and add a partner to the stockpile. The **Drawing Name** property changes to **Null** or **Undefined** for the copied connector.
- The default storage location for the partner OPC is in the plant stockpile.
- In **Catalog Explorer**, the Off-Drawing or Off-Unit OPCs are available for instruments.

**Change Default Storage Location for Partner Connector**

When you place the first OPC connector of the pair, the software places the partner in either the (plant) stockpile or the stockpile of another drawing of your choice. The default placement for the partner is into the (plant) stockpile.

1. From Smart P&ID, select **Tools** > **Options.**
2. In the **Options** dialog box, select the **Placement** tab.
3. Select or deselect the **Place partner OPC in stockpile** option, and then select **OK**.

**Notes:**

- The** Place partner OPC in stockpile** checkbox indicates that when a new connector is placed, the partner connector is automatically stored in the plant stockpile by default.
- Deselect the** Place partner OPC in stockpile** checkbox to change this default behavior. The next time you place the first connector of the pair in the drawing, the **Set Stockpile Location of Partner OPC** dialog box appears. You can use this dialog box to select the storage location for the partner connector as plant stockpile or a specific drawing stockpile.

112 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Placing Piping Components*

The **Plant Groups** section of the **Set Stockpile Location of Partner** **OPC** dialog box has two key nodes, the **Stockpile** (plant) and the plant node, for the placement of the partner connector:

- The **Stockpile** node allows you to place the partner connector in the plant stockpile.
- The plant node displays the hierarchical tree representation of the

plant. When you select a plant group node, the associated drawings

appear in the Drawing List area on the right. From this list, you can

choose a drawing to associate the partner connector with, and then the

partner connector is placed in that drawing’s stockpile.

**Orientation of OPCs**

OPC pairs have a *’to* and *from’* orientation. The software does not use the graphical *to* and *from* distinctions, but reading the drawing is easier for you with this differentiation. The OPC has two ends; a start end and a finish end.

The OPC (#237) below is a “to” connector since its connected point appears at the

“finish” end of the off-page connector. The OPC (#236) below is a “from” connector since its connected point appears at the “start” end of the off-page connector.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 113

*Placing Piping Components*

**Note:**

- To switch between *to* and *from* orientations, you must disconnect the OPC

from the line and then rotate or mirror it. Then you can reconnect the line to the other end of the OPC or pause when placing the OPC and wait for the **QuickPick** to choose the correct orientation.

114 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Placing Piping Components*

**Place an OPC or Utility Connector**

1. Select the connector you want to place from the list view in **Catalog Explorer**.
2. Click the location in the drawing where you want to place the connector.

**Notes:**

- You can place a connector in free space on the drawing and route a line to it, or you can place it at the end of a line that is already drawn.
- If you are placing a connector in free space, rotate or mirror the OPC after placement to get the correct orientation. Then route the line to it.
- If you are placing a connector at the end of an existing line, you can pause and wait for the **QuickPick** so that you can choose the correct orientation.
1. The **Set Stockpile Location of Partner OPC** dialog box opens after you place a connector on a drawing, unless you have selected the **Place partner OPC in** **Stockpile** option on the **Placement** tab of the **Options** dialog box.
2. Select the** Stockpile** (Plant) or a specific **Drawing Stockpile** for the mating OPC.
3. Select **OK.**

**Open Continuation Drawing Command**

1. Select the OPC or Utility Connector for which you want to view the drawing where the partner connector is located.
2. Right-click the connector, and then select **Open Continuation Drawing**.
3. Select **Window** > **Tile Horizontal** command to view both drawings.

**Note:**

- When the partner of the selected Off-Page or Utility Connector is in a drawing or the drawing stockpile, this command opens that drawing. This command is not available if the partner connector is in the Stockpile for the plant.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 115

*Placing Piping Components*

**Using Utility Connectors**

The **Utility Off-Drawing Piping Connector** and a **Utility Connector** symbols are delivered in the Catalog Explorer. You will need to use both connectors to graphically differentiate the utility connectors on the utility header drawing versus the drawing.

However, when you place one of these connector types (**Utility Off-Drawing Piping** **Connector** or **Utility Connector**), the mate will automatically have the same graphics as the one you placed. To maintain the relationship between the two drawings and use two different symbols, you will need to use the **Replace** command to overwrite the graphics of one of the connector symbols after placement.

1. Create a Utility Header Drawing and define a value for Fluid Code on the pipe run in which you will be placing the **Utility** **Off-Drawing** **Piping** **Connector**.
2. Place the **Utility** **Off-Drawing** **Piping** **Connector** on the pipe run in which you defined a value for Fluid Code.
3. Place the mating **Utility Off-Drawing Piping Connector** from the **Stockpile** onto the drawing. This shows the connection to the utility header drawing.
4. Turn on **Replace** **Mode** either from **Tools** > **Replace Mode** or from the toolbar.
5. Click on the **Utility Connector** symbol in **Catalog** **Explorer** that you are using to replace the Utility Off-Drawing Piping Connector.

116 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Placing Piping Components*

1. Select the **Utility Off-Drawing Piping Connector** that you just placed. This will change the graphics of the item to the **Utility Connector** symbol while maintaining the relationship to the connector on the other drawing.
2. Deselect the **Replace** Command when finished.

**Notes:**

- Placement of new items will not be permitted until you deselect the replace command.
- This procedure does not work for Off-Drawing and Off-Unit OPCs.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 117

*Placing Piping Components*

**Delete Behavior of OPCs**

If the OPC pair is on drawings, you can **Delete** a connector from the drawing, and the software moves it to a stockpile and updates the properties of its partner; the **Delete** **from Model** command is dimmed.

If the OPC you are deleting is on a drawing and the mate is in the Stockpile, then the **Delete** and **Delete from Model** commands are active; selecting **Delete** will delete the select OPC and place it in the Stockpile, select **Delete from Model** will delete the pair of OPCs (the one from the drawing and the one residing in the stockpile) from the SPPID environment.

If the OPC pair resides in the stockpile, select the **Delete Stockpile Item** from the EDE commands to remove them from the stockpile.

*Placing Instrumentation and Creating Instrument Loops* **Placing Instrumentation and Creating**

**Instrument Loops**

Several types of instrumentation, such as orifice plates, flow controllers, and pressure regulators can be placed in a drawing. Instruments are devices used directly or indirectly to measure or control a variable, such as flow or temperature, in a plant process. Instruments are also items such as flow control elements, computing devices, or electrical switches.

There are two types of instruments, in-line and offline:

- **In-line instruments** are components that you can insert into a piping segment. Inline instruments include instrument valves, such as pressure regulator valves, flow controllers, flow indicators, and other instrument components, such as orifice plates. In-line instruments will place in a line or in free space if the rules allow such placement.
- **Offline instruments** are components that you do not insert into a piping segment.

Typically, these instruments monitor and control in-line instruments. Offline instruments include flow controllers, level gauges, and system functions such as digital control stations (DCS) or computers.

Offline instruments may or may not have implied items. Implied items are items in the database with no graphical representation in the drawing file, and they are placed in the database when another item is placed in the drawing. For example, an offline instrument may imply the placement of an instrument root valve. You can establish implied items by the existence of a single item, or by the existence of a relationship between two items in **Rule Manager**. Implied items can be viewed in the EDE.

Instrument loops are a group of one or more instruments or control functions arranged so that signals can transfer from one function to the next to measure and control a process variable. You can create instrument loops containing any combination of inline and offline instruments. No loop association is required prior to placing an instrument.

Signal lines are intelligent line strings that connect offline instruments, in-line instruments, and piping. Signal lines are used to connect offline instruments to other instrument components and instrument connectors, or to connect offline instruments and other signal lines to pipelines, piping components, and equipment nozzles.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 119

*Placing Instrumentation and Creating Instrument Loops*

**Placing In-line Instruments**

1. In the **Catalog Explorer** List view or the stockpile, click the in-line instrument that you want to place on the piping segment.
2. Drag the item to the appropriate piping segment in the drawing.
3. Position the item and release it. The in-line instrument is placed on the piping segment.

**Notes:**

- You can specify values for the properties of the in-line instrument using the **Properties** window.
- As you drag an in-line instrument over a pipe run, the pipe run appears selected and allows the placement of the in-line instrument. If you place an inline instrument when a pipe segment is not selected, the instrument is placed in free space if rules in **Rule Manager** allow such placement.
- If the item you place has multiple possible orientations in relation to other items, you can use the **QuickPick** to select the appropriate placement for the item.
- While placing an in-line instrument on a pipe run with associated heat tracing, if the pointer is below the pipe run, the heat tracing appears above the instrument and if the pointer is above the pipe run, the heat tracing appears below the instrument regardless of the heat tracing orientation on the piping.

By keeping the pointer either above or below the piping, you can decide the orientation for the heat tracing on the in-line instrument at the placement time.

- After you place items, you can mirror, rotate, or move them using the manipulation handles or the commands on the main toolbar.
- Validation takes place between the pipe run and the in-line components on that pipe run with the result that you may see some properties values being copied from the pipe run to the in-line component.

*Placing Instrumentation and Creating Instrument Loops*

**Placing Offline Instruments**

1. In the **Catalog Explorer** List view or the stockpile, click the offline instrument that you want to place on the piping segment.
2. Drag the item to the appropriate place in the drawing.
3. Position the item and release to place it.
4. Add a signal line to connect the offline instrument and the piping segment.

**Notes:**

- You can specify values for the properties of the offline instrument using the **Properties** window.
- After you place items, you can move or copy them using the commands on the main toolbar.
- When you place offline instruments with implied components, the implied items are not graphical and you cannot see them in the drawing, but they are added to the database. You can display the implied items in the EDE and in the generated reports. When you delete an offline instrument with implied components, Smart P&ID deletes all the implied items that the item owns.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 125

*Placing Ducting Components*

**Placing Ducting Components**

Smart P&ID allows you to create Ducting and Instrumentation Diagrams (D&IDs).

You can place components such as rooms, equipment, ducting, piping, and instrumentation from Catalog Explorer or the stockpile in a D&ID.

The following item types are intended for use with D&IDs:

- Duct runs
- Duct nozzles
- Ducting components
- Ducting points
- Rooms
- Room components

The following D&ID reports are available:

- Duct Component MTO
- Duct Run List
- Room List

**Placing Rooms**

You can place rooms in drawings for use with ducting or piping. If required, you can place a room as a multiple representation in several drawings. After placing a room, you can:

- Attach a duct run or pipe run to a room via a nozzle
- Associate a room with instruments or with equipment such as towers, boilers, heat exchangers, and reactors
- Place room components

**Placing Room Components**

As you place room components, the software automatically creates a group relationship between the room and the component. As a group, the components move when you move the room. However, you can only associate a room component with a single room. When you place a room component, the component is associated with the last selected or highlighted room, creating a group.

126 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Placing Ducting Components*

Depending on the rules defined for the room or room component, you can define limits for the possible placements for the room. For example, a particular component can be specified for placement inside the room only, while a different component can be specified for placement outside the room only. Rule Manager defines rules that determine the way that model items interact during manipulation.

The software includes a standard group of room and room component symbols; however, you or your plant administrator can change and add to these symbols as needed for your plant.

**Associate a Room with a Plant Item**

1. Select the equipment item or instrument with which you want to associate a room.
2. In the **Properties** window or in the **Engineering Data Editor**, beside the **Room** **Tag** property, click the ellipsis button

.

**Note:**

- In the **Properties** window you can select the **Room Tag** directly by clicking the drop-down list icon and selecting the desired room.
1. On the **Find Room Tag** dialog box, in the **Search string** box, type a string corresponding to all or part of the room tag.

**Note:**

- You can use the percent character, %, as a wildcard. To display all

available room tags, type %.

1. Click **Find** to display the list of room tags corresponding to the search string you entered.
2. In the **Results** window, select the room tag of the room that you want to associate with the plant item.

**Notes:**

- In general, it is only possible to associate a room with a plant item that is in the same drawing as the room or is in the drawing’s stockpile. To

enable association of a room with a plant item in another drawing, you

must place a multiple representation of the room in the target drawing.

- Property validation is triggered when any property that comprises the room Item Tag value is added or modified: Tag Prefix, Tag Sequence

Number, or Tag Suffix. The room Item Tag format is: (Tag Prefix)-(Tag

Sequence Number)(Tag Suffix).

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 127

*Placing Ducting Components*

- The Room Tag of a plant item associated with a room comprises the same properties as the room Item Tag, and has the same format: (Tag Prefix)-

(Tag Sequence Number)(Tag Suffix). When any property that comprises

the Room Tag is added or modified, validation automatically creates a

Room Tag designated for the drawing.

- Room components and nozzles are automatically associated with the room they are attached to.

**Find Room Tag Dialog Box**

This dialog box allows you to search for and specify the room tag for the item whose properties currently appear in the Properties window or in the **Engineering** **Data Editor**. This dialog box opens when you click the ellipsis button beside the **Room Tag** property.

**Search string** — Allows you to type a string corresponding to all or part of the room tag. The percent character, %, is a wildcard. For example, if you want to list only room tags that contain the letter **R**, you can type **%R%** in the **Search string** box. If you want to display all available room tags, simply type %.

**Find** — Click to find the room tags that meet the search string criteria.

**Results** — Displays the room tags that meet the criteria in the **Search string** box.

You can choose a tag in this window and click **OK** to assign the tag to the item whose properties currently appear in the **Properties** window or in the **Engineering Data Editor**.

You can select items or groups of items using the **Select Tool** and **Polygon Fence** **Locate** icons on the main toolbar. You can select items such as piping, equipment, valves, and labels. You can also select groups of items, assemblies, or embedded or linked objects. When you position the mouse pointer over an item, it is highlighted in the highlight color. You can then click to select the item, and the color will change to the selection color. You can change the colors for the highlighted and selected items.

---

**Select Tool Command**

The **Select Tool** command

from the Main toolbar changes the pointer to the

arrow-shaped selection pointer with a circle at the end

so that you can select,

modify, and manipulate items. The circle at the end of the pointer arrow is the locate zone.

**Note:**

- When the **Select Tool** is active, the **Select Tool** **Ribbon** is displayed.

**Select Tool Ribbon**

The **Select Tool Ribbon**

is the default selection ribbon, and it

appears when nothing is selected. After you select an item, the **Select Tool** ribbon is replaced with a ribbon for editing the selected item.

**Inside** - Specifies that items inside the fence are selected.

**Overlapping** - Specifies that items both overlapped by the fence and inside the fence are selected.

130 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Selecting Drawing Items*

**Top Down** - Specifies that symbols are recognized in the locate zone as opposed to individual elements in a symbol.

**Bottom Up** - Specifies that individual elements, which make up symbols, are recognized in the locate zone as opposed to the whole symbol.

**Note:**

- You need to click either the **Inside** or the **Overlapping** icon **AND** either the **Top Down** or the **Bottom Up** icon for selecting multiple items together. You cannot select just any one icon.

**Polygon Fence Locate Command**

The **Polygon Fence Locate** command

from the Main toolbar works similarly to

the Select Tool. You can create a select set by drawing a rectangular or polygonal fence around objects based on points that you define. You can click to place the first point, click the remaining points; defining the rectangle or polygon. Points are placed when you release the mouse button. Then, you can right-click to end the fence.

**Note:**

- While the **Polygon Fence Locate** is active, the **Polygon Fence Ribbon** is displayed.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 131

*Selecting Drawing Items*

**Polygon Fence Ribbon**

The **Polygon Fence Ribbon** appears when you select the **Polygon Fence Locate** command from the Main toolbar.

**Rectangle** - Creates a select area, or fence, by drawing a rectangle around points that you define. When you drag the mouse to define a rectangular fence, a dashed rectangular outline dynamically appears as you drag. When you reach the desired size, release the mouse button to create the fence. The dashed fence outline disappears and the elements are selected.

**Polygon** - Creates a select area, or fence, by drawing a polygon around points that you define. Click to place the first point, click the remaining points to define the polygon. Points are placed when you release the mouse button. Right-click to end the polygon. The dotted outline disappears and the elements are selected.

**Inside** - Specifies that elements inside the fence are selected.

**Overlapping** - Specifies that elements overlapped by the fence are selected, as well as elements inside the fence.

132 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Selecting Drawing Items*

**Top Down** - Specifies that groups of elements are located as opposed to individual elements in a group.

**Bottom Up** - Specifies that individual elements in a group are located as opposed to the whole group.

**Turn Filter On/Off** - Turns the filter on or off. When the filter is on, the **Locate** **Filter** is active.

**Note:**

- When the filter is on, the **Locate Filter** icon is active (

). When the

filter is off, the **Locate Filter** icon is disabled (

).

**Locate Filter** - Opens the **Define Locate Filter** dialog box where you can specify a filter for the selection of specific drawing elements. Filters allow you to select specific types of drawing elements, or all drawing elements. For example, if you select **SmartSymbol** in the **Define Locate Filter** dialog box, only the labels in the defined area will be selected.

**Notes:**

- For a Smart® P&ID drawing, the only elements supported for filtering are: **All**, **Connector**, **SmartFrame**, **Symbol** and **SmartSymbol** (which selects the labels in the **Polygon Fence** selected area).
- To clear the filter selection, select **All** in the **Define Locate Filter** dialog box and click the **OK** button.

**Invert Selection** - is a toggle button. If you define an area and click this icon, it selects all the items around that area. If you click the **Invert Selection** icon again, it selects the items in the defined area.

134 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Selecting Drawing Items*

**Notes:**

- When you select multiple items, the color of all the selected items changes to the selection color. In the **Selected Items** list at the top of the **Properties** window, all the selected items are listed individually and as **Select Set**. ** **

When you select one of the items listed in the **Selected Items** list, the selected item is displayed in the highlight color to distinguish it from the other selected items. ** **

- Alternatively, you can select **Select Set** in the **Properties** window and modify the properties. Changes made to the properties after selecting **Select** **Set** are applied to all the items in the select set.
- You can also use the icons on the **Polygon Fence Locate** ribbon to define an area to select the items and create a select set.
- Many manipulation commands, like **Delete**, **Move**, **Copy**, and **Rotate**, can act upon all items in the select set.
- If you select multiple items in the **Engineering Data Editor** window, those items are also selected in the active drawing provided they reside in the active drawing. You can use this approach to construct a select set using the **Engineering Data Editor** window.
1. To clear the selection of one item and leave other items selected, click the item while holding the **Shift** or **Ctrl** key.

*Selecting Drawing Items*

**Canceling the Selection of Items**

To cancel the selection of an item or group of items, click any empty point on the drawing.

**Creating a Select Set from a Line**

1. Select a single line segment or an inline component in the drawing.
2. Select the **Edit** **> Select Connected Items** command** **from the menu bar. This displays the** Select** **Connected Items** dialog box.

**Notes:**

- Alternately, you can right-click on the line and select the **Select Connected** **Items** command on the shortcut menu.
- You can use this command to navigate the line connectivity from a selected line segment to components and other runs, constructing a select set based on matching properties. It is useful for finding branches from runs and finding all the runs and components (in a drawing) that have a common property value. Once the items are selected in the drawing, you can choose Select Set in the **Properties** window and continue editing properties for not only runs, but also lines, networks, and all runs included in the drawing.
1. In the **Select Connected Items** dialog box, change the scope of the select set by changing the display in the **Scope** list.

The **Select Connected Items** dialog box allows you to construct a select set from lines and in-line components, even if there are breaks in a network. This dialog box remains open until you dismiss it. You can highlight items in the drawing and manipulate members of the select set while the dialog is active.

136 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Selecting Drawing Items*

- The **Scope** section provides options for defining the extent of your select set.

The **Scope** list allows you to choose the extent from four options: o The **Run** option means that lines in a single run are selected.

o The **Line** option selects runs that are connected at end points, including components. This is the default value.

o The **Network** option adds branches.

o The **Drawing** option selects all the runs and inline components in the open drawing.

1. Use the **Include Runs** and **Include Components** buttons to change the scope to include or exclude lines and in-line components.

The **Include Runs** (

) and **Include Components** (

) buttons allow you to

incorporate different items into the select set. You must select either one of the buttons or both. The **Include Runs** button incorporates lines into the select set. The **Include Components** button adds in-line components into the select set.

**Note:**

- You can also select a different line segment or component in the drawing for changing the properties displayed in the dialog box. The properties for the new selection are displayed in the **Select Connected Items** dialog box, but the display of the **Properties** window is not updated until you click the **OK** button.
1. To construct a select set based on common properties, select the relevant properties from the **Properties** list in the **Matching properties** section.
- The **Matching properties** section in the **Select Connected Items** dialog box displays options for defining the select set according to common properties. The properties for the originally selected item are displayed by default.

o The **Alphabetic** icon (

) lists the properties in the alphabetical order.

The **Categorized** icon (

) displays properties grouped by specific

categories. By default, the properties are displayed categorically. Categories are defined and properties are assigned to those categories in **Data** **Dictionary Manager**.

**Note:**

- The **Alphabetic** and **Categorized** icons are toggle icons; the **Alphabetic** icon is displayed when the properties are displayed categorically, and the **Categorized** icon is displayed when the properties are displayed alphabetically.

o The **Preview** icon (

) highlights, in the drawing view, the items

that are selected according to the common properties in the **Properties** list of the dialog box.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 137

*Selecting Drawing Items*

o The **Properties List** section allows you to choose common properties for the select set. You can also choose selective properties like fluid system and inventory tag; this will select all items in the drawing with the selected properties.

**Notes:**

- You can use the **Ctrl** or **Shift** keys to select more than one property value.
- You can choose an empty property value for matching criterion, too.
- If no properties are displayed in the dialog box, select a line segment or a component that already has a property value you are interested in.
1. Click the **Preview** button to view the items that qualify according to the matching criteria specified in the previous step. The matching items are highlighted in the drawing view.
2. After selecting the items for the select set, click the **OK** button. The selected items are centered in the drawing view.

**Note:**

- If you click the **Cancel** button, the **Select Connected Items** dialog box closes, and the original item is selected in the drawing.
1. Use the **Selected Items** list in the **Properties** window to display the common properties for the select set.

*Working with Database Properties*

**Working with Database Properties**

The **Properties** window display is a two-column table that provides the common properties of the current selection in the active **Design** window. The active items always determine the content of the **Properties** window. You can only have one **Properties** window open at a time. At the top of the **Properties** window is the **Selected Items** list, which identifies the item selected in the drawing. When multiple items are selected, the **Selected Items** list itemizes all of the selected items individually and as a select set.

If only one component is selected, or all components are of the same type, all the properties of that type appear. If the select set contains components of different types, only the common properties appear. If the selected items have different values for their common properties, the value box is blank.

You can modify the values for properties in the **Properties** window. You can display and edit relationships that involve components, component types, or assemblies.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 139

*Working with Database Properties*

You can display item properties by locating the appropriate item in the **Selected** **Items** list or by selecting an item in the **Design Window**. If more than one item is selected in the **Design** **Window**, the **Selected Items** list contains the choice of **Select** **Set** as well as individual items in the set.

**Notes:**

- An item and the properties that belong to it are associated when the item is created in **Catalog Manager**.
- You can copy and paste property values in the **Properties** window by selecting a property value and pressing the **Ctrl** and** C** keys together to copy the value. Then, you can select the property where you want to paste the value and press the **Ctrl** and** V **keys together to paste the value. Do not use the** Copy**,** Cut**, and** Paste** commands on the **Edit** menu to modify property values in this window.

**Properties Window Toolbar**

You can customize the display of the **Properties** window by using the following icons on the **Properties** window toolbar:

- The **Alphabetic** icon (

) lists the properties in alphabetical order. The

**Categorized** icon (

) displays properties grouped by specific categories.

Categories are defined and properties are assigned to those categories in **Data** **Dictionary Manager**.

140 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Working with Database Properties*

**Note:**

- The **Alphabetic** and **Categorized** icons are toggle icons; the **Alphabetic** icon is displayed when the properties are displayed categorically, and the **Categorized** icon is displayed when the properties are displayed

alphabetically.

- The **Show Brief Properties** icon (

) displays the properties that have been

previously specified as brief.

**Note:**

- The software includes a default set of brief properties. You can change these properties specified as brief in the **Usage** field on the **Layout** tab of the **Advanced View Properties** dialog box. The **Advanced View**

**Properties** dialog box is accessible from the **Advanced** button in the **Edit** **View** dialog box in the **Engineering Data Editor**.

- The** Copy Bulk Properties** icon (

) copies the bulk properties of a selected

item. The properties are then available to paste onto other items.

**Note:**

- The software includes a default set of bulk properties. You can change these properties specified as bulk in the **Usage** field on the **Layout** tab of the **Advanced View Properties** dialog box.
- The **Paste Bulk Properties** icon (

) pastes copied bulk properties onto the

newly selected item or items.

**Notes:**

- To activate and use this icon, you must first select the **Copy Bulk** **Properties** icon.
- The **Paste Bulk Properties** command is useful when you need to apply changes to multiple items for correcting inconsistencies.
- The **Display Null** icon (

) displays a null value in properties that contain no

value. This option helps to avoid confusion between blank/empty cells and cells containing a zero.

- The **Show Case Data** icon (

) displays a list of case conditions, for example,

temperatures, pressures, and so forth. Case data includes both process cases and control cases, which are displayed for equipment, pipe runs, or instruments according to relevance. Check **Data Dictionary Manager** to view the case data for corresponding items.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 141

*Working with Database Properties*

- The **Show Select Set** icon (

) and the **Show Single Item** icon (

) are

toggle icons. When you select the **Show Select Set** icon and then fence select multiple items, the common properties of the selected items are displayed and the **Show Single Item** icon becomes available for selection. This option improves productivity by allowing you to change common properties immediately rather than having to first choose **Select Set** from the **Selected Items** list in the **Properties** window. When you select the **Show Single Item** icon and then fence select multiple items, the properties of a single item are displayed and the **Show** **Select Set** icon becomes available for selection.

**Note:**

- If you select the **Show Single Item** icon and then select multiple items by holding down the **Ctrl** key, Smart P&ID displays the select set properties rather than the properties for the single item.
- The **Search** feature allows you to find properties based on their display name. As you type, the properties that match the search criteria are displayed in the property window.

**Note:**

- Searches are case-insensitive.
- To clear the search, select the

icon on the right.

**Data Types of Properties**

The data types of properties determine how you will enter data for and manipulate that property’s value. Here is a list of data types that exist in Smart P&ID:

- **String** – String data types allow you to enter the text value that you want to assign to a property. For example, you may enter a description or a name for an item.

142 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Working with Database Properties*

- **Select Listed** – In Smart P&ID, some properties are restricted to preset values.

These values are called select listed values. These values reside in a select list.

Select entries are the individual members of the select list. Select lists and their select entries are defined in **Data Dictionary Manager**.

Some examples of select lists are **Nominal Diameter**, **MOC Class** (Material of Construction Class), and **Cleaning Requirements**.

- **Formatted (or unit of measure)** – Formatted properties have a default unit of measure that will be used whenever you enter a value for them. For example, the default format for temperature in an English setting project is Fahrenheit. If you enter 100 for **Insulation Temperature** in the **Properties** window, it will automatically assign 100 F.

However, if you wish to enter data in a different unit of measure from the default, you must first choose a format from the predefined list of units of measure and then enter the numeric value. The software automatically calculates and displays the corresponding value for the other units of measure.

**Notes:**

- For formatted properties, such as estimated length or maximum operating temperature, you can enter a value without a format. Use a single quote, (’) at the beginning of the entry to enter free text into a formatted property and ensure no units of measurement are assigned.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 143

*Working with Database Properties*

- The **Fluid Type** list in the **Properties** window only displays codes applicable to the type of **Fluid System** defined. For example, if you select **Process** as the **Oper Fluid System**, the **Oper Fluid Type** list will display only codes mapping to **Process** as shown in *Example A*.

To display a complete list of the available fluid code values, delete the property value, **Process**, for **Oper Fluid System**. This will display the complete list of fluid code values as shown in *Example B*.

**Hyperlinking URLs or Documents to Items**

1. In the **Properties** window, click the **Calculation** button in the **Description**

field for an item such as equipment.

1. In the **Description** dialog box, enter the URL in the **Description** text box and click the **OK** button.

**Note:**

- To hyperlink a document in the **Description** field, enter the text as:

**file:** *//servername/sharename/directory/document.extension*

144 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Labeling*

**Labeling**

Labels are used in the drawing to display certain property values of the items being labeled. The **Properties** window is the main tool to add or edit the property values.

By adding or editing property values, you are entering data into the database.

You can select the item itself or the label to add or edit the property values that appear in the label. Whenever you select a label, the corresponding label properties for its labeled item are displayed in the **Properties** window. When you select the item itself, the same properties are displayed in the long list of the item’s properties.

Selecting the label provides an easier method to find and update the label properties.

A label always reflects the current property values of the item that it labels. Labels are defined in **Catalog Manager** as **driving** or** driven**:

- **Driving labels** have a predefined property value that populates a property at placement. In other words, the predefined property value in the label

overwrites the current property value of the item that it labels.

- **Driven** **labels** do not overwrite the property value at placement.

Labels can have a **one-point** or a **two-point** placement. The placement type is defined in **Catalog Manager** when the label is created; it cannot be changed in Smart P&ID.

- **One-point** placement is used when a single point in the drawing identifies both the item to the label and the location of the label. Title blocks, flow arrows, OPCs, and some component labels use one-point placement.
- **Two-point** placement is used when you need to click to identify the item to the label and a second click to indicate a different location for the label.

**Placing a One-point Label**

 In the **Catalog Explorer** List view, click the label that you want to place.

 Move the pointer to the appropriate item in the drawing.

 When the item is highlighted, click to place the label.

**Notes:**

- The pointer position, in relation to the item when you place the label, determines if you place the label above or below the item in the drawing.
- You can quit the placement mode by pressing the **Esc** key or by right-clicking.

 Select or type values for the properties of the label using the** Properties** window.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 145

*Labeling*

**Placing a Two-point Label**

 In the **Catalog Explorer** List view, click the label that you want to place.

 Move the pointer to the appropriate item in the drawing.

 When the item is highlighted, click the item that you want to label

 Click the location in the drawing to place the label.

**Note:**

- Some labels have no **symbology** associated with them; they contain only text such as the **Short Description** label for Equipment. If you place such a label in a drawing but do not enter the properties for the label, an empty label will be displayed. Empty labels display a question mark so that you can identify them easily and avoid similar occurrences.
1. Move the label by selecting the label and dragging the black square at the center of the label.
2. The **Properties** window displays the properties of the label. Enter the value, such as name, for the label that you have placed in the drawing.

146 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Labeling*

1. Right-click the label in the drawing and select the **Show Leader Line** command to display the leader line.

**Notes:**

- If you place a leader line with the label, the first click also identifies the end of the leader.
- To manipulate a leader line, you must first display it, and then click a handle and drag the line to a new location.
- Select the **Show Leader Line** command again to turn off the leader line.

**Using the Types of Labels**

The type of label that you place determines the workflow that you follow. You define the label type when you create a label in **Catalog Manager**. When you place a label, the rules defined in **Rule Manager** are applied. There are four types of labels: **Title** **Block**, **Flow** **Arrow**, **Component**, and **Break**.

- **Title block labels** are unique among label types because you do not have to identify the item to receive the label. The title block label usually displays general information about a drawing such as the title, drawing number, and revision info.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 147

*Labeling*

- **Flow arrow labels** are placed in process piping lines. A flow arrow label is a driving label. When you place a flow arrow label, the arrow orients itself with the flow in the pipe run if you have already defined the flow direction. If you have not specified the flow direction, the direction in which you place the flow arrow defines the flow direction.
- **Component labels** identify the physical commodities in the model. A typical example of a component label is an **Equipment ID** label.

Component labels have a unique property, **Label Behavior**, and the value assigned to this property affects its behavior with the labeled item. The values for this property are defined in a select list in **Data Dictionary Manager** and are chosen in **Catalog Manager** when you create a label. Here are the permissible values for **Label Behavior**:

o **Follow (no rotate)** – This means that the label will move corresponding to changes to the labeled item but it will not rotate. ** **

o **Follow** – This ensures that the label moves and rotates corresponding to changes to the labeled item. ** **

o **Fixed** – This ensures that the label does not move if you move the labeled item.

148 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Labeling*

- **Break** **labels** or **property break labels** graphically show that changes have occurred or can occur in a property at some point in the process. This label type indicates the acceptability of an inconsistency for a specific property. As a result, warnings are not issued or an existing inconsistency resolves itself when you place the break label.

The consistency criteria specified in **Rule Manager** defines the general behavior of the properties. Break labels provide a way to define exceptions to the general rules. A break label provides a visible and printable symbol that signifies the end of one property value condition and the beginning of a new condition along a pipe. A changed property value is never propagated across a break label for that property. A break label also suppresses consistency checking for the property it breaks.

A break label can be created for any property or collection of properties of a pipe run using **Catalog Manager**. In many cases, the graphical shape of the label indicates which properties are broken.

**Placing a Title Block Label**

1. From **Catalog Explorer**, select the appropriate title block label that corresponds to your drawing template.
2. Click the label and position it over the pre-defined title area on the drawing so that the elements of the label fall within the cells of the title area.
3. Click to place the title block.
4. Press the Esc key to quit the placement mode.

**Notes:**

- Title block labels require a one-point placement.
- The title block label is embedded within a few of the delivered templates such as the *Drawing Title*.sym*.
- The different template files utilized during the creation of a new drawing contain different title block labels. To place a title block label** **within the title block, embed the title block label within the template. Alternatively, you can place the title block label after opening the drawing.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 149

*Labeling*

- You can select the **Drawing** in **Drawing Manager** and select **Edit** > **Properties** from the menu bar to modify the properties of the label.
- You can review the properties of the title block label in the **Properties** window. You can modify some of these properties using the **Properties** window, for example, **Description**, **Title**, and **Title Block Revision**.
- If you want to modify the **Name** and **Drawing Number** properties of the title block label, you must exit the drawing and make modifications using

**Drawing Manager**.

**Placing a Flow Arrow Label**

1. From **Catalog Explorer**, select the flow arrow label.

**Note:**

- The **Flow Direction** symbol is located under **Labels - Piping Segments** in the **Piping** category in** Catalog Explorer. **
1. Position the pointer over the pipe run.
2. If a flow direction has not been specified, choose an orientation for the arrow so that it reflects the correct direction.

**Notes:**

- If a flow direction has already been specified for the line, the flow arrow orients itself so that it reflects that property.
- If you pause over a line whose flow direction has not been defined, you can use the **QuickPick** to position the flow arrow.
1. Click the highlighted pipe run to place the label.
2. Continue placing flow arrows, or click the **Esc** key to quit placement mode.

**Notes:**

- Flow arrows require a one-point placement.
- You must change the flow direction of a pipe run by selecting the pipe run and changing the value of the **Flow Direction** property in the Properties window. Do not rotate a flow arrow by using the Rotate command or the

rotate handle in order to change the flow direction; flow direction is a property.

**Placing a Component Label**

1. From **Catalog Explorer**, select the label you want to place in the drawing.
2. Place the pointer over the item that you want to label.

150 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Labeling*

1. Place the label using either one-point or two-point placement methods, depending on the label.
2. Continue placing the same label or click the **Esc** key to quit the placement mode.

**Placing a Break Label**

1. From **Catalog Explorer**, select the type of break label you want to place in the drawing.
2. Click to place the break label** **in the junction of the pipe run.

**Note:**

- All the symbols under **Segment Breaks** in the **Piping** category** **in** Catalog** **Explorer** are break labels.
1. Click again to designate the location of the break label itself.

**Notes:**

- Break labels require a two-point placement so it takes two clicks to place them.
- A break label can only be placed at the endpoint of a graphical pipe line, where it connects to a component or a branch point.
- A break label can only be placed at a point where the specified properties are listed in the consistency criteria for the applicable rules. The break label stays attached to the point it was placed on and cannot be dragged away from it.
- Break labels do not set properties. They indicate that a change in the value is acceptable for the property at the indicated point. Text included in the label reflects the property at that point.
- You can associate multiple property breaks with one point on a drawing.
- After placing a break label, you can turn on or off the property for displaying the leader line.
- Break labels can be removed using the **Delete** command. If the break label is removed, the break is also removed. However, if there is another break label at the same point, the break is not removed.
- **Display Sets** can be utilized to turn off the display of break labels.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 151

*Labeling*

**Auto Labeling**

In Smart P&ID, you can perform batch placement of labels on selected items using the **Auto Labeling** tool. You can select only one label at a time when assigning labels to selected drawing items. Therefore, this process should be repeated for each label you want to assign.

1. Fence select a group of items in the drawing sheet.
2. Click Tools > Auto Labeling.
3. In the Select Catalog Item dialog box, expand the nodes in the tree view pane to select a node containing labels appropriate for one of the item types among the selected drawing items. For example, if the items you selected include pumps, you can place labels delivered with the software from any of the following catalog item folders:
- Design
- Design > Annotation > Labels
- Equipment > Labels – Equipment
- Equipment > Mechanical > Labels – Mechanical

*Labeling*

**Select Catalog Item Dialog Box**

This dialog box appears when you invoke the **Tools > Auto Labeling** command. The tree view pane shows the same item categories as you see when placing items from Catalog Explorer. When you select a folder, the symbols in that folder appear in the list view pane.

**Important:**

- In this dialog box, only those symbols that meet the following criteria are valid for selection:

o The symbol must be a label.

o The label’s item type must be suitable for assignment to at least one of the selected drawing items.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 153

*Labeling*

**Aligning Labels**

1. In a drawing, select the labels that you want to align.
2. Use the icons on the **Label Alignment** toolbar to arrange the labels with respect to the others in the group or with respect to the labeled item.

**Notes:**

- The alignment buttons use the range of the labels excluding the leader lines. Therefore, if the label only has a text box, the ranges of the label and text box are the same. However, if the label has a text box surrounded by a rectangle, the ranges of the label will be different from only the text box.

In this case, the entire range of the label will be used.

- The **Label Alignment** toolbar has the following icons:

o The **Align Left** icon (

) aligns the labels such that the left-most line

of the range is aligned.

o The **Align Right** icon (

) aligns the labels such that the right-most

line of the range is aligned.

o The **Align Center about Vertical** icon (

) calculates the center

points of each label’s range in the vertical direction and places them in a line.

o The **Align Center about Horizontal** icon (

) calculates the center

points of each label’s range in the horizontal direction and places them in a line.

o The **Align Top** icon (

) aligns labels such that the top of the ranges

are in line.

o The **Align Bottom** icon (

) aligns labels such that the bottom of the

ranges are in line.

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

**Modifying and Moving Placed Items**

After you place items in a drawing, you can modify the items in several ways. You can move items or groups of items from one location to another in the drawing. If you want to change the orientation of items, you can mirror and rotate most items. You can also move groups of items to another open drawing in the same plant hierarchy.

Depending on the rules defined for items in the drawing, limits exist for possible placements. For example, specific trays can be flagged for placement inside a piece of equipment, and you can only move these inside the equipment. Rule Manager defines rules that determine the way that model items interact during manipulation. The software processes rules defined for items as you move them, as well as when you place them.

You can resize or scale parametric items by using their parametric handles. Resizing parametric items maintains certain characteristics of the item, such as angles between elements of the symbol, while it allows modification of other characteristics of the item, such as the length of its sides. Many items are now scalable, too, and can be resized by using their scale handles.

You can modify the properties of each item by selecting the item and changing individual properties in the **Properties** window. Also, you can edit some item properties in the **Engineering Data Editor** in the **Design** window by selecting a table cell and filling in the appropriate information. You can select an entire row by clicking on the corresponding row number to the left of the table and then viewing the properties in the **Properties** window and editing them there.

If you want to remove an item from a drawing, you can delete the item. If the plant model requires the deleted item, the item appears in the stockpile for later placement.

If the plant model does not require the item, it disappears from the drawing completely. You can permanently remove required items from the plant model using the **Delete from Model** command.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 155

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

**Manipulating Items with Component Handles**

Many components allow you to change their shape or orientation using component handles. Component handles allow you to rotate or mirror a component around axes, and to scale or resize parametric items in a drawing. Items can have several different types of component handles.

The **mirror handle** allows you to mirror about the horizontal and vertical axes, defined in relation to the origin of the item. You can mirror items by dragging the mirror handle in the appropriate direction.

The **rotate handle** provides a mechanism for rotating components around their origin. You can rotate items by dragging the rotate handle in the appropriate direction.

**Parametric handles** allow you to modify different parts of parametric items.

Standard parametric handles represent up to four driving dimensions that have been applied to an item. Parametric handles can be in four standard positions: top center, bottom center, left center, and right center of the range of an item. You can scale the item parametrically by dragging any parametric handle.

**Scale handles** allow you to change the scale of a drawing item. A scalable symbol displays four solid square scale handles. A handle is displayed at each corner of the range of the symbol. You can drag any one of the handles, and the symbol scales either larger or smaller depending on the direction that you drag the handle.

**Notes:**

- Not all drawing items can be mirrored, rotated, or scaled. Catalog Manager defines these properties for items when the symbols for the items are created.
- Select sets cannot be mirrored or rotated with component handles. The **Mirror** and **Rotate** commands on the toolbar can be used for select sets.

**Mirroring an Item Using Its Mirror Handle**

1. Select an item in the drawing.
2. Click the mirror handle

.

1. Drag the mirror handle in the direction that you want to mirror the item.

156 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

**Note:**

- The mirror image, with a dashed line to indicate where the image will be mirrored, will display.
1. Release the pointer, and the item will be mirrored.

**Rotating an Item Using Its Rotate Handle**

1. Select an item in the drawing.
2. Click the rotate handle

.

1. Drag the rotate handle in the direction that you want to rotate the item.

**Note:**

- You can click the rotate handle closer to or further from the center of the item to change the step angle for the rotation.
1. Release the pointer to rotate the item to the defined position.

**Resizing a Parametric Item Using Its Parametric Handle**

1. Select the parametric item that you want to resize.
2. Drag one of the parametric handles to change the size of the item.
3. Continue dragging the parametric handles to resize the item up or down, as required.

**Note:**

- Certain properties of the parametric item, such as angle values, remain the same when you resize it.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 157

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

**Resizing a Scalable Item Using Its Scalable Handle**

1. Select the scalable item.
2. Drag any scalable handle in the appropriate direction to make the symbol either larger or smaller.

**Note:**

- Scalable symbols are created by setting the **IsScalable** property of the symbol to **True** in **Catalog Manager**.

**Mirror Command**

The **Edit** > **Mirror** command reflects one or more selected items about a line or axis that you define. You can mirror without copying, or mirror and copy by using the icon on the mirror toolbar.

To mirror an item using a defined mirror axis, click **Mirror** on the main toolbar. The software reflects one or more selected items about that axis. You can mirror the item itself, or you can make a copy of the item in the mirrored position.

**Mirror Ribbon**

The **Mirror Ribbon**

- ***appears on the main

toolbar when the **Mirror** command is active and allows you to either specify mirroring options or to observe mirroring options.

**Copy** - Copies the item or items when you mirror them.

**Position Angle** - Sets the angle of the mirror axis. The origin of the angle measurement is the point that you clicked for the beginning of the mirror axis.

- Zero degree extends the axis horizontally to the right.
- 90 degrees extends the axis vertically to the top.
- 180 degrees extends the axis horizontally to the left.
- 270 degrees extends the axis vertically to the bottom.

158 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

**Using the Mirror Command**

1. Select one or more items in the drawing.
2. Select the **Edit > Mirror** command from the main menu or click the **Mirror** icon on the main toolbar. This displays the mirror axis for the selected item.
3. Define one end of the mirror axis by clicking in an appropriate empty portion of the drawing or by clicking a key point. The software displays the mirror axis and the mirrored items dynamically as you move the pointer.
4. Position the mouse pointer so that the mirrored items appear at the desired place, and then click.

**Notes:**

- To copy mirrored items, hold the **Ctrl** key while clicking to place the items or select the **Copy** icon on the **Mirror** ribbon.
- You can use the **Position angle** field on the **Mirror** ribbon instead of positioning the mirror axis dynamically.

**Rotate Command**

The **Edit** > **Rotate** command rotates one or more items a precise distance or angle about a specified point. To rotate an item, select the item and then click the **Rotate** icon on the Main toolbar. To define the rotation axis, specify two points by clicking in the drawing. Then, click again to complete the rotation of the item.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 159

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

**Rotate Ribbon**

The **Rotate Ribbon** appears when the **Rotate** command is active, and allows you to either observe rotation options as you rotate an item or specify rotation options.

**Copy** - Creates a copy of the item that you are rotating.

**Position Angle** - Displays the angle between the horizontal axis through the center of rotation (A) and the point that you rotate from (B). Then, if you rotate the item, the position angle (C) changes to become the angle between the horizontal axis and the point to which you rotate. The position angle is always a positive value measured counterclockwise from the axis.

**Rotation Angle** - Defines the rotation angle. The rotation angle is the angle between the point from which you rotate and the point to which you rotate. In the following picture, the center of rotation (A) shows the point (B) from which you rotate the item.

The rotation angle (C) is the angle of change between the old and new positions of the rotated item. The value is always positive.

**Step Angle** - Specifies the rotation step angle. The step angle specifies the increments, in degrees, that an item rotates on a rotation axis. You can enter increments in the **Step Angle** box. For example, if the box is set to 30.0, the rotation is displayed in 30-degree increments. The default setting is 0 degrees so that the rotation is fully dynamic.

**Rotating an Item About an Axis**

1. Select one or more items.
2. Select **Edit** > **Rotate** or on the main toolbar, click the **Rotate** icon on the Main toolbar.
3. Click to define the center rotation point. The software dynamically displays a reference axis for the rotation.
4. Click to define the other end of the reference axis, the rotation handle. The software dynamically displays the rotation axis and elements being rotated. The location and the position of the reference axis defines the rotation *from* point.
5. Position the items, and then click to define the rotation *to* point.

**Note:**

- To copy the rotated items into the new position, you can hold **Ctrl** while you click to define the *to* point or select the **Copy** icon on the Rotate ribbon.

**Moving Items**

You can move items in a drawing using the **Select Tool** or the **Move** icons. You can move a line using its vertex handles. You can also move an item or group of items to another drawing using the **Move to Drawing** command.

**Moving an Item Using the Move Command**

1. In the drawing, select an item or a group of items that you want to move.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 161

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

1. Select the **Edit > Move** command from the menu bar or click the **Move/Copy** icon (

) on the main toolbar. This displays the **Move** ribbon.

**Note:**

- The **Move** ribbon allows you to either specify the values for the **Step** **distance** field and the **X** and **Y** coordinates when moving items, or to observe the changing values of the **X** and **Y** coordinates when you move items by clicking in the drawing to specify the *from* and *to* points. The **Move** ribbon includes the following options:

o The **Copy** icon copies the items in the select set when you move them.

o The **Step distance** field increases or decreases the value in the ribbon boxes. For example, entering a step value of 0.25 and pointing away

from the *from* point increases the distance in discrete steps that is from 0.25 to 0.5, 0.75, and so on.

o The **X** field allows you to enter an explicit value for the distance to move in the x-coordinate. You can also observe the value in this field

as you drag the object.

o The **Y** field allows you to enter an explicit value for the distance to move in the y-coordinate. You can also observe the value in this field

as you drag the object.

1. Click to define the *from* point.
2. Click to define the *to* point.

**Notes:**

- You can also specify the step distance or the new x- and y-coordinates for the item on the **Move** ribbon**.**  Alternatively, you can select the items and drag them to the new location. ** **

---

162 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

- To copy the selected items, press the **Ctrl** key when you place the items at the new location or select the **Copy** icon on the **Move** ribbon. You can then change the names of the items.
- If you move an item that owns other items, the owned items also move. For example, if you move a vessel that owns trays and nozzles, the trays and nozzles also move with the vessel.
- To move an item to another drawing, move it to the stockpile. Then, open the second drawing, and place the item in the drawing from the stockpile.

Alternatively, you can use the **Move to Drawing** command.

- You can use other view manipulation commands, such as **Zoom**, **Fit**, and **Pan**, while using the **Move** command. When you finish manipulating the view, the software returns to the **Move** command at the point where you started manipulating the view.

o While using the **Pan** command to manipulate the view, you can right click to exit the **Pan** command and return to the **Move** command.

**Moving an Item Using the Select Tool**

1. On the main toolbar, click the **Select Tool** icon.
2. Position the pointer over the item but not over any of the handles of the item.

When the item you want to select is highlighted, click to select it.

**Note:**

- Dragging a handle modifies the item instead of moving it.
1. Drag the item to its new location.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 163

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

**Using the Move to Drawing Command**

1. Open the source and destination drawings.
2. In the source drawing, select the items that you want to move to the destination drawing.
3. Select **Edit > Move to Drawing**. ** **

**Notes:**

- The **Move to Drawing** command** **allows you to move a select set of items from one drawing to another open drawing. The following conditions must be met for the** Move to Drawing **command to be available:

o The** **source and destination drawing must be open and these drawings must not be read-only.

o The drawing objects to be moved must be selected.

o The selected items must not have a connection with any items outside the select set.

o Only users with appropriate permissions can modify the items in the select set.

- The **Move to Drawing** command manipulates the select set in order to make sure the selected items are appropriate to move.

The command removes these objects from the select set:

o Inserted OLE objects and title blocks are automatically removed from the select set.

o If there is a label in the select set and the item that it labels is not in the select set, that label is removed.

o If a dependent object (such as a nozzle, equipment component, actuator, or item note) is in the select set but the parent object that it is dependent upon is not in the select set, the dependent object is removed from the select set.

The command expands the select set to include the following objects:

164 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

o If there are labels that are not in the select set but are attached to objects in the select set, these labels are automatically added to the select set.

o If a dependent object (such as a nozzle, equipment component, actuator, or item note) is not in the select set but the parent object that it is dependent upon is in the select set, the dependent object is automatically added to the select set.

o OPCs and connected items can be moved to a different drawing. After the OPC has been moved, the partner drawing is out-of-date because the OPC

information needs to be updated. Opening the drawing or running the

**Update Drawing** command updates the OPC and removes the out-of-date status.

1. Select the *from* point.

**Notes:**

- For the purposes of placement in the destination drawing, the * from* point becomes the origin of the select set.
- While you are using a *from* point (or *to* point in the destination drawing), the pointer is a crosshair.
1. If more than one possible destination drawing is open, the **Move to Drawing** dialog box appears. This dialog box allows you to choose the destination drawing where you want to move the item(s).

The **Available drawings** list in the **Move to Drawing** dialog box contains a list of possible drawings. Source drawings, open read-only drawings, open drawing templates, and open assemblies are not included in the list.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 165

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

1. Select the drawing and click the **OK** button. The destination drawing displays in the **Drawing View** and the select set of items is attached to the pointer, which is a crosshair.
2. Select the *to* point in the destination drawing.
3. A message box is displayed to confirm the movement.
4. Click the **OK** button to confirm the movement. The selected items move to the destination drawing. You can use the **Window** menu to view both drawings and tile them horizontally to view the items that have been moved.

**Copying Items**

Copying an item makes it possible to use a drawing item that is already in place as a starting point for placing a new item. There are several methods to copy items, such as using the **Copy** icon on the main toolbar or using the **Ctrl** key while you mirror, rotate, or move a drawing item.

Placement rules are in effect when you copy an item to a new location just as they are when you originally place an item in a drawing from the stockpile or **Catalog** **Explorer**. Therefore, a copied nozzle must be placed on a piece of equipment.

**Copying an Item Using the Copy Command**

1. In the drawing, select the item that you want to copy.
2. Select the **Edit > Copy** command from the menu bar. The **Copy** command replaces the contents of the clipboard with the selected elements and their associated relationships.

166 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

1. Select the **Edit > Paste** command from the menu bar. This pastes the item on top of the original item. To view the pasted item, you must move the new item to the desired location in the drawing.

**Notes:**

- When you copy more than one element at a time, the relationships shared among the selected elements are also copied. However, if you copy an

element that shares a relationship with an element that is not selected for copying, the relationship is not copied.

- You can also copy an item by using the **Select Tool** command. To do this, click the **Select Tool** icon on the main toolbar, hold the **Ctrl** key, select the item, and then drag it to the desired location. Do not drag the handles of the item.
- You can also copy an item by using the **Move** command. To do this, select the item, click the **Move** icon on the main toolbar, and then press the **Ctrl** key as you place the item in the drawing. You can use the same approach to copy a select set.

**Copying Labels**

1. In the drawing, select the label that you want to copy.
2. Right-click the label and select the **Place New** command from the shortcut menu.
3. This displays a new label icon at the end of the pointer.
4. Highlight the appropriate item and click to associate the new label icon with the item. The label is placed at the specified location in the drawing.

**Finding and Replacing Items**

Smart P&ID allows you to find items and inconsistency indicators in a drawing. You can define the search criteria based on a catalog item or an item type already placed in the drawing. You can also define the criteria based on a delivered or a user-defined filter. Once you find all drawing items of a certain type, you can modify their properties, reposition them, or even replace them with an item of a compatible type.

Searching your drawing for inconsistency indicators allows you to review and correct inconsistencies systematically.

You can replace a single drawing item with a comparable item, replace many items one-by-one, or even replace all items of one type at the same time. When you find or replace all drawing items matching the specific criteria, the selected items are added to a select set. This allows you to view the common properties of the items in the select set by using the **Properties** window and edit the properties, if appropriate.

**Note:**

- The **Find** and** Replace** commands are not available in the **Engineering Data** **Editor** window.

**Finding and Replacing Items in a Drawing**

1. Select the **Edit > Find** command from the menu bar.

**Note:**

- You can also select the **Edit > Replace** command. This displays the **Find** **and Replace** dialog box. In this dialog box, either the **Find** or the **Replace** tab is activated depending on the command used to launch the dialog box.
1. From the **Find what** pull-down list, select an appropriate option such as **Catalog** **Item**.

**Note:**

- The **Find what** pull-down list includes the search criteria. This field allows you to enter new search criteria or select from a list of the five most 168 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

recently used criteria. The items listed above the dashed line in the list are used to set new search criteria by using the **Catalog Item**, **Filter**, or **Inconsistency** options.

o Selecting **Catalog** **Item** displays the **Select Catalog Item** dialog box.

o Selecting **Filter** displays the **Select Filter** dialog box.

o Selecting **Inconsistency** disables the **Replace with** option since you cannot replace an inconsistency.

1. In the **Select Catalog Item** dialog box, select the catalog item to search for, and click the **OK** button.
2. From the **Replace with** pull-down list, select **Browse** to choose a catalog item from the **Select Catalog Item** dialog box.
3. In the **Select Catalog Item** dialog box, select the catalog item to replace the selected drawing item, and click the **OK** button.

**Note:**

- You can also select a replacement item from the list of the five most recently used items listed below the dashed line, if available.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 169

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

1. From the **Search in** pull-down list, select an option, such as **Active Drawing –**

**Primary**, to define the scope of the search.

**Note:**

- You can search the **Primary** view, **Typical** view, or **Both** views in the active drawing or the active window. There are six options available in the **Search in** pull-down list: **Active Drawing - Primary**, **Active Drawing -**

**Typical**, **Active Drawing - Both**, **Active Window - Primary**, **Active** **Window - Typical**, ** **and** Active Window - Both. **

o If any of the** Active Window** options is selected, the **Scroll** **mode** feature is not available. If any of the **Active Drawing** options is selected, the **Scroll mode** feature is automatically set to **Zoom**, but you can select a preferred scroll mode.

1. From the **Scroll mode** pull-down list, select an option, such as **Pan**, to control how the drawing view changes when a drawing item is found or replaced.

**Note:**

- There are three options available in the **Scroll mode** pull-down list: **Off**, **Pan**, and **Zoom**. If you select **Zoom**, the active view is zoomed to a multiple of the range of the drawing item found. If you select **Pan**, the active view is shifted without changing the view scale so that the center of the drawing item is in the center of the view. If you select **Off**, the **Scroll** **Mode** feature is turned off and the active view is left unchanged.
1. Select **Next** or **Previous** in the **Direction** section to specify the direction of the search. **Next** allows to move forward and **Previous** allows to move backward in the drawing to search for items.
2. Click the **Find** button to initiate the search for a single item that matches the search scope. Each time you click the **Find** button, Smart P&ID will search in the defined direction and highlight the next drawing item that matches the defined search criteria. Each time a matching item is found, the active view changes based on the **Scroll mode** setting.
3. Click the** Find All** button on the **Find** tab to initiate a search for all items matching the search criteria and add them to the select set. The active view is updated based on the **Scroll mode** setting.
4. Click the **Replace** button on the **Replace** tab to replace the selected item. Each time you click the **Replace** button, the located item is replaced, and the **Find** command continues based on the setting in the **Direction** field. Based on the **Scroll mode** setting, the active view is updated as each drawing item is found.

The **Replace** button is available only when the item found can be replaced by the item defined in the **Replace with** field.

1. Click the **Replace All** button located on the **Replace** tab to replace all items that match the **Find what** criteria with the item defined in the **Replace with** field without prompting. After all the replacements are completed, the software reports 170 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

the number of matches found and the number of replacements made. The active view is also updated depending on the **Scroll mode** setting.

**Notes:**

- The **Replace** command does not allow a non-breaking component to be replaced with a break component.
- You can use the **Replace** command or the **Find and Replace** dialog box to replace a multiple representation symbol provided the definition

attributes for the source (parent) and target (child) are identical. The definition attributes are **Equipment Class**, **Equipment SubClass**, and **Equipment Type**.

**Undo Command**

The **Edit > Undo** command allows you to reject the last action that you completed.

You can also press the **Ctrl** and **Z** keys together to undo the last action.

An action that can be undone is defined in several ways. Running a command is usually an action. Modifying item properties is also an action; it ends when another item is selected. This definition of an action also holds true for select sets (multiple items selected in the drawing or in the **Engineering Data Editor** window).

Modifying the properties of a select set is one action in and of itself; it is not one action for each member of the set.

Up to ten operations are saved in the **Undo** buffer, and you can undo them by repeated use of the **Undo** command. The **Undo** buffer is cleared when you:

- Change the properties of the drawing view on the **View Properties** dialog box.
- Turn off or on the display of inconsistency indicators by selecting the **View >** **Show Inconsistencies** command from the menu bar.
- Select the **File > Save** command from the menu bar.
- Open a different drawing or switch to another open drawing.
- Open a new **Drawing View** or new **Engineering Data Editor**.
- Perform **Plant Editing**.
- Move a connector to another drawing stockpile by using commands in the EDE or on the shortcut menu.
- Enter the **Auxiliary Graphics** mode.

**Notes:**

- If you are placing items in a **Typical** view, the **Undo** command will undo the placement of all the typicals placed in the last operation (not just the last typical record placed) and return the user to the **Primary** view. ** **

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 171

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

- The **Undo** command does not reverse view manipulations; you can use the **View > Previous** command for this purpose.
- If the **Undo** command is not available, it indicates that the undo list has been cleared and you can no longer undo your last action.

**Deleting Items**

You can delete a single item or a select set of items from a drawing by selecting the item(s) and clicking the **Cut** icon (

*)* on the main toolbar or by selecting the **Cut**

command from the **Edit** menu or the shortcut menu. This removes the selected item from the drawing and places it on the clipboard, which allows you to paste the item in the same location in the drawing and then move it to another location, as appropriate.

You can also delete items in a drawing by selecting them and clicking the **Delete** icon (

) on the main toolbar or pressing the **Delete** key on the keyboard. When using the **Delete** key to delete items, you must point to the **Drawing View** before pressing the **Delete** key. Smart P&ID does not delete the item or the select set if the pointer is located anywhere outside the drawing view. When you click the **Delete** icon on the main toolbar or press the **Delete** key, the setting for the **Delete Key Default** **Behavior** is used.

**Default Delete Key Behavior**

The default behavior for the **Delete** key is defined in the **Delete Key Default** **Behavior** option in **Options Manager > Settings**. This option specifies the default behavior when you select drawing items and press the **Delete** key or click the **Delete** icon on the main toolbar. You can select one of the three available options:

- **Delete from Model** – This option deletes the item and all the data associated with the item from the database as well as from the drawing.
- **Delete to Plant Stockpile** – This option deletes the item from the drawing and sends it to the plant stockpile.
- **Delete to Drawing Stockpile** – This option deletes the item from the drawing and sends it to the drawing stockpile.

When certain symbols are deleted from the drawing view, they will reside in the **Stockpile**. This means they have been deleted from the drawing, but are still available to be placed elsewhere in that drawing or in another drawing. There are two factors that govern whether an item will go to the **Stockpile** once it’s deleted from a drawing.

The property values specified when an item is created in **Catalog Manager** and the setting in **Options Manager** affect the outcome of cutting or deleting the item. If the **TagReqdFlag** property of an item is set to **True** in **Catalog Manager** and the item is included in the **StockpileItems** setting in **Options Manager**, cutting or deleting the item from the drawing places it in the stockpile. The data associated with the item 172 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

remains in the database. An exception to this is when you use the **Delete** icon on the main toolbar or the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the item and the default behavior for the **Delete** key is set to **Delete from Model** in **Options Manager**.

**Deleting an Item from a Drawing**

1. Select the item or items that you want to remove.
2. Click the **Delete** icon (

) on the main toolbar.

**OR**

1. Select the item or items that you want to remove.
2. Point to the **Drawing View** and press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to remove the item or the select set from the drawing.

**OR**

1. In the drawing, right-click the item that you want to remove. This will display the shortcut menu.
2. From the shortcut menu, select the **Delete from Model** or **Delete to Stockpile** (**Plant** or **Drawing**) command. Alternatively, you can use the **Delete from Model** or **Delete to Stockpile** (**Plant** or **Drawing**) command on the **Edit** menu on the menu bar.

**Notes:**

- The **Delete** command is available on the shortcut menu for some items such as labels.
- If you select the **Delete from Model** command, the selected item is not only deleted from the drawing but also from the database; it is not placed in the stockpile, regardless of the setting in **Options Manager** or the property values specified in **Catalog Manager**.
- You can use the **Delete to Stockpile** command to delete an item from the drawing and send it to the plant or drawing stockpile by using the commands available in the **Delete to Stockpile** submenu.

*Modifying and Moving Placed Items*

**Deleting an Item from the Plant Model**

1. In the drawing, right-click the item that you want to remove. This will display the shortcut menu.
2. From the shortcut menu, select the **Delete from Model** command. This will delete the item from the drawing and the plant model; the database. The item will not be placed in the stockpile. When you save the drawing, no data associated with the item will remain in the database.

For more information related to modifying and moving items placed in a drawing, refer to the user guide * SPPIDUsers_Guide.pdf. *

**Deleting Stockpile Items**

Most items in the stockpile do not have any relationships and can be deleted.

However, some plant item groups, for example loops, packages, and so forth, exist in the stockpile and have relationships to member items on a drawing or in a stockpile.

If the plant item group is deleted, the software will show a message that the plant item group is being referenced and ask for confirmation to delete. If you confirm the delete, the plant item group will be deleted but the drawing items will not be deleted.

The reference to the plant item group (such as the Package Item Tag, Loop Tag, etc.) will be removed from that item.

When an OPC is in the stockpile, it maintains its relationship to the partner OPC.

OPCs can be deleted from the stockpile only if both OPCs in a pair are in the stockpile and are deleted at the same time.

*Using Filters*

**Using Filters**

You can use filters in many ways throughout Smart P&ID and its stand-alone applications and utilities. You can use filters in a display set for the drawing view or in the **Engineering Data Editor.** For example, you can create a display set and use a filter to show all pumps in the drawing view. You can then select all the pumps and edit their properties one-by-one or as a select set in the **Properties** window. You can apply the same filter to the **Engineering Data Editor** in a layout or with an asking filter to display a list of pumps and their properties in a tabular format. You can then edit the properties of the pumps.

You can use filters when you create report templates to display items on a report. You can use filters in Rule Manager to define how items interact within a view. You can associate filters with the source or target properties in rules and use filters to find and replace items.

You can create filters to control the display of hierarchy items in Drawing Manager.

These filters are not saved to any folder in **Filter Manager**, but the methods of creating these filters are the same as those for creating filters saved in **Filter** **Manager**.

Filters can help you show different views of the same drawing and can make your workflow more efficient. For example, you can use a filter to display an operational drawing or an under-construction drawing. You can use filters to show all items added after a certain date or after a certain revision number. You can also use filters if you want to delete items of a certain type.

**Managing Filters**

Filters are used extensively throughout the SmartPlant engineering suite, and can be applied to an entire plant or to an individual user. The plant administrator can create, edit, or delete the filters for the entire plant. The individual user can only view, select, and apply plant filters. However, the user can create personal filters, which are saved on the local computer, and can be edited or deleted. There are two main types of filters, simple and compound.

- **Simple Filter** – A simple filter is a filter that only uses one criteria specification (either **And** or **Or**). There may be two or more properties defined in the filter, but all use the same criteria.
- **Compound Filter** – A compound filter is a filter comprised of two or more simple filters. A compound filter combines the **Match all** and **Match any** criteria (**And** and **Or**).

**Select Filter Dialog Box**

When you work in an application and need to work with filters, you will access the **Select** **Filter** dialog box. This dialog box is an interface very similar to the **Filter** *Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 175

*Using Filters*

**Manager** application, and it allows you to create and manage filters. There are two main folders in the **Select Filter** dialog box, **Plant Folders** and **My Folders**.

**Plant Folders** include all plant-specific filters. All users working on the plant can access the plant filters.

**My Folders** contain personal filters. These filters appear only when the owner is the current user. You can create new simple and compound filters under **My Folders**.

**Important:**

- As a best practice, create new filters, copy filters, or add shortcuts to filters in the **Plant Folders** rather than moving or modifying the original filters. For instance, the filters in the **Filters for Rules** folder. **Rule Manager** uses plant filters such as **Filters for Rules**; modifications to these filters impact and could possibly prevent the placement of items in the drawing.

The **Display Filters** folder is a good place to organize the filters that you frequently use such as display sets. They help to control the display of the various views in the design software.

The **Tree** view in the **Select Filter** dialog box shows the organizational structure of the filters. Filters appear in the folders as either a single filter (simple filter) or a group of filters (compound filter). You can create folders and subfolders to organize the filters. You can cut, copy, paste, and rename folders and filters.

176 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Using Filters*

**Notes:**

- In the Tree view, compound filters can be identified by a (**+**) sign in front of them, which indicates that they contain multiple simple filters.
- When you point to the name of a compound filter in the Tree view in the **Select Filter** dialog box, the filter description is displayed as a tooltip.

**Simple Filter**

A simple filter is a filter that only uses one criteria specification (either **And** or **Or**).

There may be two or more properties defined in the filter, but all are using the same criteria.

Double-clicking a simple filter in the Tree view in the **Select Filter** dialog box displays the **Filter Properties** dialog box. You can also display this dialog box by selecting a filter in the Tree view and clicking the **Properties** button in the **Select** **Filter** dialog box.

**Filter Properties Dialog Box**

The **Filter Properties** dialog box specifies properties of a filter, including the name, description, and the other properties for which you want to filter. The dialog box will look different, depending upon whether you have selected a simple filter or compound filter. Each item type owns a set of properties. The examples of item types are **Equipment**, **Instrument**, and **Pipe Run**, and examples of properties for these item types are **Equipment Type**, **Instr.Loop Part Number**, and **Estimated Length**, respectively.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 177

*Using Filters*

**Name** - Specifies the filter name. The name can be any combination of characters and has no length limit. Filter names within a plant must be unique. This name appears as the filter name on the Filter Manager interface.

**Set as asking filter** - Select this check box to define the filter as an asking filter.

When an asking filter is invoked on its own or as part of a display set, you are prompted to change the values in the **Operator** and **Value** fields for the filter properties. Clear the check box to define the filter as a regular simple filter.

**Description** - Allows you to specify a phrase or sentence about the filter. The description can be any combination of characters and has no length limit. The description appears as a ToolTip when you point to the filter name on the Filter Manager interface.

**Filter for** - Contains the top-level items from the data dictionary. This area allows you to specify available properties in the **Definition** grid.

**Definition** - Displays all defined criteria associated with a filter. To add to or modify the definition list, you must select a line in the list and then define or edit the property in the **Edit** group.

- **Match all** - Specifies that items matching ALL the filtering criteria pass through the filter.
- **Match any** - Specifies that items matching any one or more of the filtering criteria pass through the filter. **Match any** is the default matching method.
- **Add** - Places a new entry at the end of the existing definition list and enables the options in the **Edit** group so you can edit the new entry.
- **Delete** - Removes the selected criterions from the definition list. This button is available only when you select a criterion in the definition list.

**Edit** - Allows you to define or edit a single line of filter definition criteria.

- **Property** - Displays a list of all properties for a certain item type. Examples of properties include **Equipment Type**, **Instr.Loop Part Number**, and **Estimated Length**. You define or modify filtering criteria by selecting a property, an operator, and a value.
- **Operator** - Specifies the relationship between the property and the specified value. Relationships include, for example, greater than (>), equal to (=), not equal to (<>), and so forth.
- **Value** - Lists appropriate values for the property specified in the **Property** column. If a list of attributes is not already associated with the **Value** box, you must type a value, which can be free text, or choose null. You can type a percent sign (**%**) as a wildcard character to find multiple characters, or type a question mark (**?** ) as a wildcard character for a single character. Do not use an asterisk () in the **Value** box.

178 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Using Filters*

**Compound Filter**

A compound filter consists of two or more simple filters, and combines **Match All** and **Match Any** criteria (**And** and **Or**). Simple filters are added to a compound filter either by dragging the simple filter to the compound filter folder or by creating new simple filters under the compound filter in the filter hierarchy. Compound filters apply only to homogeneous item types.

You can nest one or more simple filters in compound filters to build a more complex collection of items. For example, if you have a filter that shows the secondary piping in the drawing and another filter that shows the primary piping, you can combine these filters to show all of the piping without the hose. You can even nest compound filters for more complexity.

Double-clicking a compound filter in the Tree view in the **Select Filter** dialog box displays the **Compound** **Filter Properties** dialog box. You can also display this dialog box by selecting the compound filter in the Tree view and clicking the **Properties** button in the **Select Filter** dialog box.

**Compound Filter Properties Dialog Box**

The **Compound Filter Properties** dialog box specifies the properties of a compound filter, including the name, description, and the filter method to indicate whether all or any of the simple filter criteria must be matched.

**Name** - Specifies the filter name. The name can be any combination of characters and has no length limit. Filter names within a plant must be unique. This name appears as the filter name on the Filter Manager interface.

**Description** - Specifies a phrase or sentence about the filter. The description can be any combination of characters and has no length limit. The description appears as a ToolTip when you point to the filter name on the Filter Manager interface.

**Filter Method** - Allows you to decide whether items must meet all or only one criterion to pass through the filter.

- **Match all** - Specifies that items matching ALL the filtering criteria pass through the filter.
- **Match any** - (Default) Specifies that items matching any one or more of the filtering criteria pass through the filter.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 179

*Using Filters*

**Notes:**

- All filters that make up the new compound filter need to be of the same item type shown in the **Filter for** list in the **Filter Properties** dialog box. For example, all the simple filters making up a compound filter can be of type **Equipment: Mechanical**. You cannot mix **Equipment: Mechanical** with **Equipment: Heat Transfer** or any other item type.
- Once a simple filter has been assigned to a compound filter, all simple filters created under that compound filter will have the same value in the **Filter for** field as the first simple filter. This is because all simple filters under one compound filter must be of the same item type.
- If the **Select Filter** dialog box is open, do not open **Filter Manager** and make any changes to filters.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 183

*Working with Assemblies*

**Working with Assemblies**

An assembly is a group of items that you can place in a drawing at one time.

Assemblies can save a considerable amount of time because you do not have to keep creating commonly used groups of items. Instead of copying and pasting each individual item into a drawing at several locations, you can place them together as a group of items: the assembly. An example of an assembly is a control valve with vents on both sides, an instrument loop that controls the valve, and a piping bypass around the valve.

You can create an assembly by selecting several items in a drawing and saving as an assembly. The file extension for an assembly is .pid, which is the same file extension as a drawing file. To retrieve the assembly from the **Catalog Explorer** Tree view, you must save the assembly where the other symbols are located.

Placing assemblies is like placing any other item from **Catalog Explorer** into a drawing. You can select the assembly from **Catalog Explorer** and click a location in the drawing. Alternatively, you can drag the assembly into the drawing.

**Creating an Assembly**

1. In the drawing view, select items that you want to group. Deselect any items that you do not want to include in the assembly.
2. Select **File** > **Save As Assembly** from the menu bar.

**Important**

- A red target appears at the end of your pointer. Use this to specify the origin of the assembly which is utilized during placement of the assembly.
1. Click to specify the origin of the assembly.

**Note:**

- You can only use a standalone symbol or unattached ends of pipe runs as the origin of an assembly. You cannot use labels, pipe runs, signal runs, or child items as the origin of an assembly.
1. The **Save As Assembly** dialog box appears.

184 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Working with Assemblies*

1. Enter the file name in the **File name** field in the **Save As Assembly** dialog box. *** ***

**Note:**

- The **Save As Assembly** dialog box prompts you to save the assembly in the default **Assemblies** folder, which is specified in **Options Manager**. To save the assembly, you must have write permissions to this folder. You

can save an assembly in any folder provided you have the appropriate

permissions. However, if you use the default folder to save the assembly, you can retrieve and place the assembly from **Catalog Explorer**.

1. Click the **Save** button in the **Save As Assembly** dialog box. This will display a message indicating that the assembly has been created.

---

1. Click the **OK** button to close the message box.

**Notes:**

- Any graphics that have been band-aided should be deleted and replaced prior to creating an assembly.
- Assemblies can be created in one plant and used in another. However, the file structure and symbols used in the two plants must be identical. If you try to place an assembly into a plant that uses a different file structure, an error message is displayed indicating that Smart P&ID cannot find your reference files and the assembly placement is cancelled. In such situations, you must move the symbols that cannot be found to the location indicated in the error message.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 185

*Working with Assemblies*

- You can reference the *_CreAsm.log* file in the **~** *\Temp* folder when the assembly is created.

**Placing an Assembly**

1. From the **Catalog Explorer** List view, drag the assembly that you want to place in the drawing.

**Note:**

- The mouse pointer indicates the origin point of the assembly, and the assembly items appear in red at the end of the mouse pointer to aid in

placement.

1. Release the mouse to place the assembly.

**Note:**

- Press the **Esc** key or right-click anywhere in the drawing view to quit the placement mode.
1. A message is displayed indicating the assembly has been placed. Click the **OK**

button to close the message box.

---

186 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Working with Assemblies*

1. Connect the pipe runs and instruments on either side of the assembly.

**Notes:**

- You cannot place an assembly into a line that is already routed. You must place the assembly first and then route piping to it, if required.
- After you have placed an assembly, the items in the assembly are treated as separate items. You can modify or delete individual items in the assembly, as necessary. You can delete just one item from the assembly without deleting the entire assembly.
- The information in each label remains intact when you place the assembly.
- You can reference the *_PlaAsm.log* file in the **~** *\Temp* folder when the assembly is placed.

**Assembly Reference Data**

The following assembly categories are provided under **Assemblies** in the reference data delivered with Smart P&ID:

**Equipment:** This category contains equipment assemblies.

**Instrumentation:** This category contains instrumentation assemblies **Piping:** This category contains piping assemblies.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 187

*Working with Typicals*

**Working with Typicals**

The term “**Typicals**” in P&ID design indicates to the viewer of the drawing that what is shown is not the complete story. A typical is a user defined, single graphical representation of repeated sets of objects and their relationships. The typical may be visually represented as a single item or any combination of items up to and including a complete P&ID. Typicals may include any items depicted in **Catalog Explorer**, including OPCs.

In the drawing, a typical marks the position of where similar groups of items should appear but have been hidden from view to reduce congestion in the model and to make the drawing clearer. For example, in a drawing, a note and a typical that contains a utility pipe, a reducer, a valve, and a utility OPC, informs the viewer that at this position on the drawing there is more than one group of these items.

In Smart P&ID, the original set of items from which the typicals are created resides in the **Primary view** and all typicals reside and display in the **Typical view** of the drawing. To view all typicals and their attributes, the user must switch from the **Primary view** to the **Typical view**. Though the typical items reside in a different view, all relationships with the objects in the Primary view are maintained once they are established. Typicals can be placed repeatedly any number of times.

**Note:**

- Typical does not mean identical. The extent to which a typical record will deviate from the primary representation is a matter of company practice and plant rules.

188 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Working with Typicals*

New item tags will be generated for the typical items according to the plant rules. In addition, there may also be differences in some property values of the items. Item properties are editable in the **Typical view** just as they are in the **Primary view**. Once the typicals have been created, a change to one typical will be propagated to the other typicals** ** *ONLY* if specified** **by the plant rules and** System** **Editing**.

In the example of the utility station above, if the diameter of the utility pipe section on the left is changed from 1 ½ to 2 in the **Primary view**, the pipe sections in the three typicals in the **Typical view** will not change automatically. It must be changed manually. However, if a cleaning requirement is assigned to the vertical pipe, it will propagate to all the connected typicals due to the rules set up for **System** **Editing**.

**Note:**

- The items which are placed in the **Typical view** have a property **Is_Typical**.

The value for this property is assigned by Smart P&ID and cannot be changed by the user.

**Drawing Views**

Smart P&ID offers three drawing views for creating and manipulating typical records: Primary, Typical and Both (which consists of the Primary and Typical views). The user can toggle between all three views by selecting one of the three toggle icons representing the commands, **Show Typical, Show Primary, or Show** **Both** on the **Typical** ribbon.

Alternatively, you can toggle between the three views by selecting one of the three commands (**Show Typical, Show Primary,** or** Show Both**) from the** View **menu.

**Important**

- The command for the currently active view is disabled on the main toolbar and the View menu. The disabled appearance of the icon

on the main

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 189

*Working with Typicals*

toolbar, the grayed-out command on the View menu, and the indicator on the status bar

indicates which view is currently active.

**Notes:**

- When the **Show Primary** command is disabled on the menu, the **Primary** **View** is active. The **Primary view** shows all objects which reside in the primary view. The **Is_Typical** property value for items in the Primary view is **False**. Items from which typicals are created are initially placed in the Primary view.
- When the **Show Typical** command is disabled on the menu, the **Typical** **View** is active. The **Typical view** shows all typicals; all items which reside in the Typical view. The **Is_Typical** property value for items in the Typical view is **True**. When creating a typical, the software automatically switches to the Typical view to allow placement. You can also switch to the Typical view manually and place items in the Typical view directly.
- When the **Show Both** command is disabled on the menu, both the

**Primary** and the** Typical Views **are active. The** Show** **Both** command is a combination of the Primary and Typical views. In this view, all items in the drawing and on the Primary and Typical views are visible. This view must be active when items in the **typical view** need to be connected to items in the **Primary view**.

**Commands to Manipulate Typicals**

The **Edit** menu has three commands to manipulate typicals (**Move to Typical**, **Move** **to Primary**, and **Create Typical**).

- The **Move to Typical** command** **moves the selected items from the Primary** **view to the Typical view. This command is only enabled when the Primary** **view is active and items have been selected.

190 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Working with Typicals*

- The **Move to Primary** command moves the selected items from the Typical view to the Primary** **view. This command is only enabled when the Typical view is active and items have been selected.
- The **Create Typical** command creates a typical from the items selected in the Primary** **view and opens the Typical view for placement. This command is only enabled when the Primary** **view is active and items have been selected.

**Creating a Typical**

1. In the drawing, select the items to be included in the typical.
2. Select the **Edit >**  **Create Typical** command.

**Note:**

- If you have selected an item but excluded its parent item, you will receive a message about the removed item and it will be removed from the select set (refer to *Important* note at the end of this procedure). Click the **OK**

button on the message box to proceed.

1. This displays an origin point

in the drawing view.

1. Select a standalone symbol as the origin of the typical and click to place the origin point for the typical items.
2. The software activates the Typical View and the select set of items is attached to the cursor.

**Note:**

- To cancel the command at this point, press the ESC key or right-click anywhere.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 191

*Working with Typicals*

1. Select a location for placement and click to place the typical. The select set will remain attached to your cursor for repeated placement.
2. Select another location for placement and click to place more Typicals, as needed.
3. Right click or press the Esc key to end the typical placement mode.
4. Return to the Primary view to add items to the typical. You can add the items removed from the select set when creating the typical and any additional items.
5. Select the desired item, such as a nozzle, and then select the **Edit > Move to** **Typical** command from the menu bar. This will move the selected item to the Typical view. You can then adjust the position of the item or the typical.

**Notes:**

- You cannot create a typical while the **Show** **Both** command is active.
- Although typicals are seen when either the **Show Typical** or **Show Both** commands are active, there is no graphical indication in the Primary view that a typical exists. Therefore, you must add a note to the Primary view indicating that a typical is present.

**Important**

- When creating a typical, if nozzles are included in the select set but the parent item is not, the nozzles are not included in the typical.

A message is displayed to communicate that the particular item will be

removed to create a typical.

192 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Working with Typicals*

Click the **OK** button on the message box to proceed. After creating the typical, you can return to the Primary view and add the removed item, such as a nozzle, to the typical and then connect, as required. This behavior is the same as the current copy/paste behavior where a nozzle cannot be copied and pasted without including the parent item.

**Connecting a Typical to an Item in the Primary View**

**Note:**

- If a typical is connected to items in the Primary view (such as the **Connect to** **Process** line in the previous example), these connections are not maintained in the Typical view, and you must reconnect them manually.
1. Select the **Show Both** command from the View menu or the Typical ribbon to display both the Primary and the Typical views. The inconsistency indicators will indicate the places where the pipe runs are not connected.
2. Connect both lines in the Typical view to the **Connect to Process** line in the Primary view.

**Notes:**

- Items in the Primary and Typical views share the same graphical

coordinates. Items related to each other affect items in the other view when they are moved. For example, if the typical contains nozzles

attached to a vessel in the Primary view and the vessel is moved, the

nozzles in the Typical view move with the vessel and any pipe runs

attached to the nozzles are affected.

- There is no connection/correlation between the property values of the items in the Primary view and the items in the Typical view. If you

modify the properties of the primary items or any of the typical items, it is your responsibility to make the same changes to all other items, if necessary.

- The **Is_Typical** property is available for display in the Properties window and the Engineering Data Editor as well as for use in

generating reports and filters. Therefore, items in the Typical view are identifiable and are not excluded from database queries or reports

unless you choose to exclude them.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 193

*Working with Typicals*

- The items included in the typical are not treated as a group for

movements or other graphical manipulations. Once a typical has been

placed, the items become separate just like an assembly.

- Boundary conditions (connecting typical items to primary items) must be managed by the user.
- Auxiliary Graphics are not included in the typical.
- Display Sets are applicable to the Primary and Typical views.
- System Editing propagates data from the primary items to the typical items according to the plant’s defined rules.
- Here are the guidelines for using OPCs in typicals:

o OPCs may be included in the typical. When placing a typical

containing an OPC in the Typical view, the partner OPC will

automatically go to the plant stockpile, regardless of the **Place**

**partner OPC in stockpile** setting in the **Tools > Options >** **Placement** tab. You are responsible for moving the OPC to the

corresponding drawing stockpile, if necessary, and attaching it to

the pipe run in the drawing.

o An OPC placed, from **Catalog Explorer** while the Typical view is active, generates the partner OPC and places it according to the

**Place partner OPC in stockpile** setting in the **Tools > Options >** **Placement** tab.

o OPCs carry the **Is_Typical** property and property values can differ between a pair of OPCs.

- In the EDE, the active view changes if a single item is selected or if all items selected in the EDE belong to the same view. If the selected

items are a mixture of typical and primary items, the active view

remains as is. The properties of all the selected items are displayed in the Properties window.

- The pipe runs placed in the Primary view are not gapped by pipes in

Typical view and vice versa. The **Tools > AutoGap** and **Tools > Gap** **Now** commands are disabled when both views are active.

- With Save As to **AutoCAD/MicroStation/SmartSketch**, typical

items are presented in the saved drawings on a different layer/level.

- Executing the **Undo** command after typical placement cancels the placement of all typicals placed in the last operation (not just the last typical placed), and switches the view to the Primary view. Switching

views is an undoable command.

*Adding Design Elements*

**Adding Design Elements**

The **Design** category encompasses a range of elements that can be used on a P&ID

such as annotations (or notes), area breaks, packages, and revision clouds. Title block labels are also included in this category.

**Using Annotations**

Annotations are model items used to add notes, remarks, and other information to effectively annotate drawings. You can use annotations to include any type of information previously inserted into a drawing using primitive commands.

Annotations include everything from geometric shapes to extension and dimension lines. When annotations are parametric, you can resize them based on your requirements.

Annotations consist of a graphic and a label, and they provide a way to place free remarks in a drawing. You can also associate annotations with other items in the drawing such as equipment. Placing annotations works like placing any other item in a drawing. However, when you place an annotation in a drawing, you must first place a graphic and then attach the label. The graphics are located in the **Graphics** folder, and the labels are located in the **Labels** folder under the **Annotation** node in **Catalog** **Explorer**.

**Notes:**

- Most of the labels require placing a graphic on the drawing first and then attaching a label to the graphic. However, there is one symbol in the **Labels** folder with a built-in graphic and label; it is called **Item Note & Label**.
- You cannot annotate drawings by opening them in **SmartSketch** and adding dumb graphics to the drawing. Opening and saving a .pid file in **SmartSketch** can corrupt the file, making the drawing unusable.

**Placing an Annotation**

1. From the **Catalog Explorer** Tree view, select **Design > Annotation > Graphics**.
2. From the List view, select the **Annotation Point** symbol.
3. Click to place **Annotation Point** at the appropriate place in the drawing.
4. Press the **Esc** key to quit the placement mode.
5. From the **Catalog Explorer** Tree view, select **Design > Annotation > Labels** to add a label to the **Annotation Point**.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 195

*Adding Design Elements*

1. From the List view in **Catalog Explorer**, select the **Text** symbol.
2. Click to place **Text** on the **Annotation Point** using a two-point placement; the first click selects the graphic and the second click places the label in the drawing.
3. Select the label and then, in the **Properties** window, select the **Note Text** field to enter text. This displays the **Note Text** dialog box.
4. Enter the text in the **Description** field in the **Note Text** dialog box, and click the **OK** button.

**Note:**

- To move the annotation to another location, select the **Annotation Point** (the plus sign) and drag it to the required location.

**Associating an Annotation to an Item**

1. From the **Catalog Explorer** Tree view, select **Design > Annotation > Labels**.
2. From the List view in **Catalog Explorer**, select the **Item Note & Label** symbol.

**Note:**

- The **Item Note & Label** symbol under **Design** > **Annotation** > **Labels** in **Catalog Explorer** has a built-in graphic and label. It contains the **Annotation Point** and the **Text** symbols in one symbol.
1. Drag **Item Note & Label** over the equipment until the equipment is highlighted.

This associates the annotation to the equipment.

196 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Adding Design Elements*

1. Select the label and then, in the **Properties** window, select the **Note Text** field to enter text. This displays the **Note Text** dialog box.
2. Enter the text in the **Description** field in the **Note Text** dialog box, and click the **OK** button.

**Notes:**

- If you delete an item and **Item Note & Label** is associated to this item, the **Item Note & Label** is also deleted. This is true for all annotations.
- To move the annotation to another location and maintain its association to an item, press the **Alt** key, select the annotation graphic (the plus sign) of the **Item** **Note** **and** **Label**, and then drag it an arbitrary distance to the required location.
- If you have a number of items with associated labels that are placed remotely from those items and it is not clear which label belongs to which item, you can right-click on the annotation graphic and select the **Select Associated Item** command. Alternatively, you can select **Edit > Select Associated Item** from the menu bar. This highlights the associated item when an annotation is associated with a drawing item, such as equipment or piping component.

*Adding Design Elements*

**Packages, Systems, and Hydraulic Circuits**

Package, contract package, hydro test package, test systems, safety class, and hydraulic circuits are similar to instrument loops; they are a group of items with a common set of properties. For example, you may want to have a package to denote items that will be included in a palette. A system could be used to denote the portions of a P&ID used for testing prior to startup. With hydraulic circuits**,**  you can define many-to-many relationships between the hydraulic circuit and items in the drawing; that is, multiple hydraulic circuits can be associated with pipe runs or vessels.

To associate items with a package, contract package, hydro test package, test systems, safety class, or hydraulic circuits, you will use the **Package Item Tag**, **Contract** **Package No**, **Hydro Test Package No**, **Test Sys Item Tag**, **Instr Safety Class Item** **Tag**, or **Hydraulic Circuit Item Tag** properties.

**Important**

- Some catalog items do not possess the property necessary to associate them with a package or system. When selecting items for the select set, do not include such items. If any member of the select set does not possess a

property, the property will not appear in the **Properties** window.

For example, for the **Package Item Tag** property to appear, you must not include OPCs and item notes. For the **Test Sys Item Tag** property to appear, you must not include OPCs, item notes, and trays. For the **Instr Safety Class** **Item Tag** to appear, you must include only instruments and not OPCs, item notes, equipment, and piping.

**Placing a Package**

1. From the **Catalog Explorer** Tree view, select the **Symbols > Design** node.
2. Right-click **Package** in the **Catalog Explorer** List view.
3. From the shortcut menu, select the **Send to Stockpile** or **Send to Drawing** **Stockpile** command, whichever is appropriate.
4. In the **Properties** window, enter a value such as **SKID123** for the **Item Tag** property.

**Note:**

- Alternatively, you can enter the value for the **Item Tag** in the **Engineering Data Editor** window.
1. From the Drawing view, select items that you want to include in the package.
2. In the **Properties** window, choose **Select Set** from the **Properties** window.
3. In the **Properties** window, select the appropriate value from the **Package Item** **Tag** list. This list contains the **Item Tag** for each package in the stockpile. All 198 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Adding Design Elements*

items in the select set will be assigned the same value for the **Package Item Tag** property.

**Note:**

- Plant item groups, such as instrument loops, packages, safety classes, and so forth, frequently reside in a stockpile with their members residing on

drawings. Moving the plant item group itself to another stockpile has special limitations:

o **From a drawing stockpile to the Stockpile** - No constraints apply. This action can occur at any time.

o **From the Stockpile to a drawing stockpile** - If the plant item group contains only items in the destination drawing or does not contain items in any other drawing, this action is allowed.

o **From a drawing stockpile to another drawing stockpile** - Same

constraint as above applies.

**Associating Hydraulic Circuits with an Item**

**Important**

- Open **Options Manager** and make sure that Hydraulic Circuit appears among the items included in the **StockpileItems** setting. This setting specifies the item types that can appear in the plant or drawing stockpiles when items of that type are deleted from a drawing.
1. From the **Catalog Explorer** Tree view, select the **Symbols** > **Design** node.
2. In the List view, right-click **Hydraulic Circuit** and select the **Send to Stockpile** command.

204 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Auxiliary Graphics*

**Auxiliary Graphics**

You can use the **Auxiliary Graphics** command to insert simple graphics in the Smart P&ID drawings. When you add auxiliary graphics in a drawing, they display in the drawing inside a SmartFrame. The SmartFrame and its contents are stored in the database.

**Auxiliary Graphics Mode**

To insert auxiliary graphics and work in the auxiliary graphics mode, select the **Edit**

**> Insert > Auxiliary Graphics** command from the menu bar. The **Auxiliary** **Graphics** command displays the **Draw** toolbar and opens a drawing sheet that displays the items in the drawing. The items existing in the drawing cannot be selected or edited; they are displayed only for viewing. In the auxiliary graphics mode, only some of the Smart P&ID commands are available; the commands that are not available are disabled.

To return to the Smart P&ID drawing, select the **File** > **Close Auxiliary Graphics** command from the menu bar. When you return, you cannot move or edit the auxiliary graphics placed using the **Auxiliary Graphics** command. To edit the auxiliary graphics again, either double-click on the **SmartFrame** or right-click and select the **Edit** command from the shortcut menu.

The **Draw** toolbar displays vertically on the left side of the drawing sheet as the default toolbar; it provides commands to draw and edit the auxiliary graphics. It contains commands for working with continuous lines and arcs, tangent arcs, curves, free form drawing, circles, rectangles, fillets, text, and so forth. The commands used for auxiliary graphics match the basic Rapid Application Development (RAD) commands used for **SmartSketch®**. However, the commands exclusive to **SmartSketch** are not included.

**Notes:**

- You can customize the **Draw** toolbar using the **Tools > Customize** command on the menu bar. The available commands are displayed with the word

Auxiliary as a suffix to the command name. However, the customizations

made to the **Draw** toolbar are lost when you exit the auxiliary graphics mode.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 205

*Auxiliary Graphics*

- Two more toolbars, **Change** and **Relationship**, are also available. These toolbars are initially hidden and can be activated from the **View** > **Toolbars** command on the menu bar.

o The** Change **toolbar contains the** Move/Copy**,** Offset**,**  Rotate**,**  Mirror**,**  **

**Scale**, **Bring To Front**, ** Send To Back**,**  Pull Up** and** Push Down**, and** Group** and **Ungroup** icons. ** **

2. Select the **File > Close Auxiliary Graphics** command from the menu bar to exit the auxiliary graphics mode and return to the Smart P&ID drawing. The auxiliary graphics will display in a **SmartFrame** inside the drawing. ** **

**Notes:**

- Once auxiliary graphics are drawn and inserted in a drawing, they can be turned on or off (displayed or hidden) by selecting or deselecting **Notes** in the **View > Properties > Display** tab. *** ***
- If you add auxiliary graphics for an item in Smart P&ID, such as a base for a vessel, and then move the item (vessel) in Smart P&ID, the auxiliary graphics will not move with the item. You must edit the **SmartFrame** where the auxiliary graphics were added and reposition the graphics separately. ** **
- The **Undo** buffer is cleared each time you enter the auxiliary graphics mode.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 207

*Auxiliary Graphics*

**Editing Auxiliary Graphics**

1. To edit auxiliary graphics in a drawing, place the mouse pointer over the graphics to be edited. This displays a pink **SmartFrame** around the auxiliary graphics.
2. Double-click the **SmartFrame** or right-click the **SmartFrame** and select the **Edit** command from the shortcut menu. This opens the auxiliary graphics for editing in the auxiliary graphics mode.

**Notes:**

- The** Prevent selection of inserted objects **option** **on the** View > Properties >** **Display** tab** **must be unchecked if you want to select the** SmartFrame** in a drawing.
- If you select the **Edit > Insert > Auxiliary Graphics** command again instead of editing the existing **SmartFrame**, you will enter into a new auxiliary graphics session. You will be able to create auxiliary graphics, but you will not be able to edit the auxiliary graphics created in the previous session. Each time you insert auxiliary graphics, additional **SmartFrames** are added in the drawing.

**SmartSketch Settings Command**

The **Tools >**  **SmartSketch Settings** command defines the pointer behavior and customizes the operation of Smart P&ID to recognize and place relationships allowing you to draw with precision.

208 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Auxiliary Graphics*

**Note:**

- When you select the **Tools** menu in Smart P&ID, the **SmartSketch Settings** command is disabled. You must be in the auxiliary graphics mode to enable the **SmartSketch Settings** command.

**SmartSketch Settings Dialog Box**

The **SmartSketch Settings** command displays the **SmartSketch Settings** dialog box, which allows you to define the pointer behavior and the relationships that are recognized by Smart P&ID as you draw.

The **Relationships** tab in the **SmartSketch Settings** dialog box shows displays the symbols that will appear in the drawing when you approach a relationship point. The relationships selected controls the relationship handles or glyphs that are shown while the user is drawing within auxiliary graphics and Smart P&ID.

**Notes:**

- The relationship handle is the graphic or glyph used to represent a geometric relationship between elements, key points, and dimensions, or between key points and elements. The relationship handle shows that the designated

relationship is being maintained.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 209

*Auxiliary Graphics*

- You can set the relationships that you want to recognize and clear the relationships that you do not want to recognize. If you clear all relationships, the software will not show relationship handles.
- When you select the **File > Close Auxiliary Graphics** command from the menu bar to turn off the auxiliary graphics mode, the selected relationships are retained allowing you to place and manipulate items with precision in Smart P&ID.

The **Cursor** tab in the **SmartSketch Settings** dialog box shows the **Cursor setup** section. This section allows you to define the size of the locate zone and the intent zone around the mouse pointer. It controls how close the cursor must be to an item for the glyphs to appear.

- **Locate zone** is the region around the pointer. This is the key element in drawing since Smart P&ID recognizes relationships based on elements within the locate zone. This ensures that you do not need to move your pointer to the precise location. For example, if part of an element is within the locate zone, Smart P&ID

recognizes a **Point On** relationship. The size of the locate zone is indicated by the circle around the center of the pointer crosshair. The permissible values for locate zone are 3 to 12 pixels.

- **Intent zone** allows the drawing commands to interpret your intentions as you draw. The permissible values for intent zone are 3 to 12 pixels.
- The **Preview** section in the **Cursor** tab shows the size of the locate zone and the symbol of the selected relationship. This section does not reflect the changes made to the intent zone.

210 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Linking and Embedding OLE Objects*

**Linking and Embedding OLE Objects**

Smart P&ID is compatible with Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) software. You can transfer text, numbers, or images between drawings or documents that were created with this software and other OLE applications. You can use a whole document or specific parts of a document. The information that you insert is an object.

For example, you can use Microsoft Word to make a comment and then display the comment in your drawing, or you can insert a Microsoft Excel worksheet into a drawing. You can even create a drawing that contains another drawing, notes from Microsoft Word, and an Excel worksheet.

To insert information created in another application, you can use several methods:

- Cutting and pasting objects – This deletes the item from one location and moves it to another location.
- Copying and pasting objects – This duplicates the item in another location.
- Linking objects – This uses stored data from one location and places a copy with a link in another location. When you change the original data, the copy can be updated either automatically or manually.
- Embedding objects – This copies information and stores it in another document created using a different application. If you change the embedded object, the original information does not change and vice versa.

**Embedding or Linking Objects**

You can copy and then insert information using the **Paste Special** command on the **Edit** menu. Using the **Paste** option in the **Paste Special** dialog box, you can paste and embed the object in the destination drawing

**Note:**

- You can also embed an entire document in a drawing by using the **Insert >** **Object** command on the **Edit** menu. On the **Insert Object** dialog box, deselect the **Link** checkbox.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 211

*Linking and Embedding OLE Objects*

Using the **Paste Link** option in the **Paste Special** dialog box, you can paste and link the object in the destination drawing; a reference point or box is inserted into the destination drawing. This box displays the information that you pasted. The linked data is stored in the source document itself. You can edit the linked object by opening the source document.

**Note:**

- You can also link an entire document to a drawing by using the **Insert** **>** **Object** command on the **Edit** menu. On the **Insert Object** dialog box, select the **Link** checkbox. When you change the original data, the inserted data is updated either automatically or manually.

When linking an object, the software creates automatic links by default. An automatic update occurs when the drawing is opened. If a change is made to the source document and the drawing is already open, the change does not appear in the drawing until it is closed and re-opened. The software updates manual links only at the time you indicate. To change the way the software updates links, select the **Links** command on the **Edit** menu to display the **Links** dialog box.

**Links** – This list displays the names and paths, types, locations, and update settings of the linked source files in the active drawing.

**Cancel** – This button closes the **Links** dialog box without saving any changes made.

**Update Now** – This button updates the selected links.

212 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Linking and Embedding OLE Objects*

**Open Source** – This button opens the selected file in the source application for editing.

**Change Source** – This button changes the source file for the selected link to a different file.

**Break Link** – This button breaks the link between the source file and the P&ID

drawing. The data for broken links is no longer updated if the source file changes.

After you break a link, it no longer appears in the **Links** list.

**Update** – This section allows you to specify whether your link is updated automatically or manually. If you select **Automatic**, whenever you change the linked information in the original document, the linked document is automatically updated.

If you select **Manual**, you will need to click **Update Now** to update information in the document.

**Notes:**

- If you want to keep the document size small, link the data to another document. Linked information increases the document size only by the size of the displayed image, not by the size of the data itself. Linking is also useful when you want to share information in many places such that the information is updated automatically at all instances. For example, if you want to display a drawing in several different reports created in Word, you can link the drawing in the documents that contain the reports. Later, if you update the drawing by editing it in Smart P&ID, each report would automatically display the results of the updates made in the drawing.
- If the document size is not important, you can use embedding. Embedded objects increase the file size. Embedding is useful when the person viewing the document with the embedded information does not have access to the

software that created the embedded object. Even without access to the

software, the person can view the information embedded in the document. For example, if you want to send several drawings for review, you can embed each drawing in a Word document and send the Word document to the

reviewer. Embedded information is good if the information does not need to be updated.

**Embedding by Cutting or Copying, and Pasting**

The easiest way to embed an object is to use the **Cut**, **Copy**, and **Paste** commands on the **Edit** menu in any OLE software. If you copy or paste information into an application, which does not allow editing the information, the information is automatically embedded in the document. You can then edit the embedded

information with the software that created it. If you cannot edit the information, the information appears as a static picture.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 213

Then, click the **Browse** button. This displays the **Browse** dialog box.

1. Browse to the appropriate folder on your computer and select the file that you want to embed.
2. Click the **Open** button in the **Browse** dialog box. This closes the **Browse** dialog box and displays the path of the selected object in the **Insert Object** dialog box.
3. To link the document to the drawing, select the **Link** option. To embed the object into the drawing, ensure the **Link** option is deselected.
4. Click the **OK** button to close the dialog box.
5. Click at the position in the drawing where you want to insert the object. The object will be linked or embedded in the drawing.

**Editing a Linked or Embedded Object**

1. Open the drawing that includes the linked or embedded object that you want to edit.
2. Double-click the object to open the software that created the object.

**Notes:**

- When editing the linked or embedded object, the menus and toolbars of the current software are temporarily replaced by the menus and toolbars of the source software that just opened. If you do not have the source

software installed, you cannot edit the object.

- You can also right click the object, and select the **Edit Object > Edit** or **Open** commands on a shortcut menu to activate the software that created the object.

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

**Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor**

The **Engineering Data Editor** (**EDE**) window uses a grid or tabular format to display the query results for the database. The default **EDE** is automatically displayed in the lower-left part of the main window. You can also open the **EDE** to appear in the **Design** window.

**Types of EDE**

There are three types of the EDE:

- **EDE in the Design Window –** You can open one or more EDEs in the Design Window using the **Window > New > Engineering Data Editor** command from the menu bar. The EDE window opened in the Design Window should be used to edit information **ONLY** in the active drawing(s), not the other (non-active) drawings. ** **
- **Default EDE –** The default EDE window is automatically displayed in the lower-left part of the main window when you select the **View** > **Toolbars** > **Engineering** **Data Editor** command from the menu bar. You can also select the **Engineering** **Data Editor** icon (

) on the toolbar or select the **View** > **Display** > **Engineering** **Data Editor** command from the menu bar. You can use the default EDE to edit data for all objects in the plant (objects in the active drawing, the stockpiles, and the other (non-active) drawings).

- **Standalone EDE** – The **Standalone EDE** is available when the Smart P&ID

Modeler is opened without selecting any drawing. You can open the **Standalone** **EDE** by selecting **File > Open > Standalone EDE** command from the menu bar in **Smart P&ID** without any drawing open. It opens a standalone version of the **Engineering Data Editor** and on selecting an item type, all items of that type in the plant and in the plant stockpile are displayed in the EDE grid. In a standalone EDE, you can run all the commands for querying and editing the data as you can in a standard EDE. ** **

**Important:**

- To distinguish between the default **Engineering Data Editor** window and the **Engineering Data Editor** window opened in the Design Window, use the title bar.

**Property** — Displays a list of all properties for a certain item type. Examples of properties include revision number and name. You define or modify filtering criteria by selecting a property, an operator, and a value.

**Operator** — Specifies the relationship between the property and its value.

Relationships include, for example, greater than, >; equal to, =; not equal to, <>; and so forth.

**Value** — Lists appropriate values for the property specified in the **Property** list. If a list of attributes is not already associated with the **Value** box, you must type a value, which can be free text, or choose null. You can type a percent sign (%) as a wildcard character to find multiple characters or an underscore (_) as a wildcard character for a single character. Do not use an asterisk (*) in the **Value** box.

**Save to Excel Command**

You can use the **Save to Excel** command to save the data displayed in the current view to an Excel sheet. A busy indicator appears while the Excel file is being generated and on completion of generation, you are prompted to open the file.

**Note:**

- If a filter is applied on the EDE, only the filtered records appear in the Excel sheet.

**Query Results Dialog Box**

The **Query Results** dialog box appears if the database query has requested more information than can appear in the interface (when the number of rows exceeds 350,000 / number of columns or 65,637, whichever value is smaller). This limit is imposed by the Microsoft® FlexGrid Control, which is used in the EDE. You can refine the query to display fewer items or enter the report-only mode in the EDE and run a report on the query results.

**Maximum Allowed** - This field displays the currently allowed number of items in the **EDE**.

**Rows Returned** – This field displays the number of items that your query returned.

**Options** – This section allows you to choose between refining your query or entering report-only mode.

220 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

- The **Refine query definition and try again** option allows you to use the **Additional filter criteria** list in this dialog box for refining the query to display an allowed number of items in the view.
- The **Continue with this query so I can generate a project or personal report** **(Query results will not be displayed)** option enables only the **Edit View**, **Save** **View**, **Delete View**, **My Reports**, and **Plant Reports** commands in the **Edit** menu in the **Engineering Data Editor** window. This option is useful when creating a report for large data sets such as the entire plant database.

**Additional Filter Criteria** - This section displays all new criteria to add to the current filter. To add to or modify the definition list, you must select a line in the list and then define or edit the property in the **Edit** group.

- Use the **Match all** option to display only items matching ALL the filtering criteria.
- Use the **Match any** option to display items matching any one or more of the filtering criteria.

**Edit** - This section allows you to define or edit a single line of filter definition criteria.

- The **Property** list includes all properties for a certain item type. Examples of properties include **Equipment Type**, **Instrument Loop Item Tag**, and **Estimated Length**. You can define or modify the filtering criteria by selecting a property, an operator, and a value.
- The** Operator** list specifies the relationship between the property and its value.

Relationships include greater than (>), equal to (=), not equal to (<>), and so forth.

- The **Value** list includes appropriate values for the property specified in the **Property** column. If a list of attributes is not already associated with the **Value** field, you must either type a value, which can be free text, or select Null. You can type a percent sign (**%**) as a wildcard character to find multiple characters or a question mark (?) to find a single character. Do not use an asterisk (*) in the **Value** field.

**Add** - This button places a new entry at the end of the existing definition list and enables the options in the **Edit** group so that you can edit the new entry.

**Delete** – This button removes the selected criterion from the definition list. This button is available only when you select a criterion in the definition list.

**Customizing the Data in the EDE**

In addition to using **EDE Scope** and **Asking Filters** in the EDE toolbar, additional features can be used to change the content and layout of the** **EDE rather extensively.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 221

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

**Search the Grid**

As you type in the **Search**

- ***field, items that match the search criteria are

highlighted yellow in the grid. To clear the search, select the

icon on the right.

To search for multiple strings, use an asterisk (*) as a separator between each search string.

**Notes:**

- If no cells in a row contain a match to the search string, that row is hidden from the view.
- If no cells in the entire grid contain a match to the search string, all rows are hidden, and the **Search** field is displayed with a red border.
- When pagination is invoked, you can apply the search to all pages or to the current page only. The search options work as follows with pagination: o **Current Page** – Displays only the rows from the current page that have matching strings. If there are no matching strings on the

current page, all the rows on that page are displayed.

o **All Pages** – Displays the rows from all pages that have matching strings. The rows are displayed in one or more pages

corresponding to the total number of rows with matching strings

and the number of rows per page that was set.

**Group Columns in the Grid**

Data in the **EDE** can be grouped by a specific attribute by dragging the column header to the **Grouping** area where the following text appears “Drag a column header and drop it here to group by that column.” If the **Grouping** area is not visible, select the **Enable Grouping**

- ***button on the EDE toolbar. You can group more than one

attribute, by dragging an additional column header to the **Grouping** area. The order in which you apply the grouping changes the order of the displayed results.

**Note:**

222 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

- When pagination is invoked, grouping is applied to the current page only.

**Freeze Columns in the Grid**

To freeze columns, hold the cursor between the leftmost column and the adjacent column until it changes to a double-headed arrow, and then drag the vertical bar to the end of the last column you want to freeze. To unfreeze the columns, position the cursor on the bar and when it changes to a double-headed arrow, drag the bar back to the extreme left.

**Sort Columns in the Grid**

Upon opening a view in the **EDE**, the results are displayed in ascending order based on the **Item Tag** column. Select a column header to sort by the values in that header in ascending order. To change the sorting order to descending, select the column header again. A small arrow in the column header displays the sort order. Selecting the column header a third time removes the sorting (rows are sorted in ascending order by the **Item Tag** column values). Press and hold the SHIFT key and click columns to sort by more than one column. When sorting my multiple columns, the column headers display a small number beside the arrow to indicate the column sequence for sorting.

When sorting data in ascending order, the sorting behavior depends on the type of data as follows:

- For columns with units of measure, the values are sorted in order of SI value regardless of the units, for example: 3.5 mm, 3.0 cm, 2.000 in, 4.0

in. Where several identical SI values exist, sorting is as follows:

o Identical values with the same units of measure, but with a

different number of decimal places are sorted in ascending order

according to the number of decimal places, for example: 2.0 in,

2.000 in.

o Identical values with different formats based on the same type of

units of measure are sorted in ascending alphabetical order of the

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 223

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

units (with symbols preceding letters of the alphabet), for example:

3.0”, 3.0 in or 5.0 mil, 5.0 mm.

- For a select list consisting of numeric values (for example, Nominal Diameter), the values are sorted by their numeric index.
- Values for all other data types are sorted alphabetically.

**Notes:**

- Cells with NULL values are not sorted and always appear at the top of the grid.
- Empty cells are sorted and appear at the top when sorting in ascending order and at the bottom when sorting in descending order.
- If properties are sorted for a particular column and one of the values in that column is changed, the software re-sorts the values immediately.
- When pagination is invoked, sorting applies to the entire data set.

**Filter Columns in the Grid**

You can filter your data in the **EDE** by using the column filter. To do so, select the **Filter**

icon in the column header. The **Filter by Column Data** dialog appears, allowing you to select from the list of values listed in the column using the check boxes, or type in a value to filter based on criteria you specify in the **Show rows with** **value that** section. A filtered column is indicated by a solid Filter icon. To clear

the filter, select the solid Filter icon, and in the **Filter by Column Data** dialog box select **Clear Filter**.

**Notes:**

- If filtering is already applied ad a filtered value outside the range defined by the filter, the row with the new value is immediately excluded from the grid display.
- When pagination is invoked, filtering applies to the entire data set.

**Filter by Column Data Dialog Box**

The **Filter by Column Data** dialog box allows you to specify criteria for the selected column to determine the display of items in the **EDE**. This dialog box opens when you select the Filter icon at the top of one of the columns in the **EDE**.

224 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

---

**Clear Filter** — Clears all previously-defined filter settings and closes the dialog box.

**Search** — Performs a search-as-you-type filter on column values for which any part of the column value matches the search string.

**Select All** — Click once to select all the check boxes beside the values shown for the column. Click again to clear all the check boxes (equivalent to canceling the filter on the column values). The check box displays a black square inside when only some of the column values are selected.

**(Unique value check boxes)** — Displays the unique strings for all the values that appear in the column. If the column contains blank cells, these are indicated by the value **[empty]**. Select check boxes beside the values to be included; clear check boxes beside the values to be excluded.

**Show rows with value that** — Allows you to specify additional filter criteria based on strings that comprise all or part of the data values. The comparison operator includes options such as **Contains**, **Is Equal To**, **Is Not Equal To**, **Is Greater Than**, **Starts With**, **Ends With**, and so forth. When specifying several criteria, you can choose **And** or **Or** to specify the relationship between the criteria as follows:

- **And** — Means that both the current and succeeding criteria must be met.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 225

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

- **Or** — Means that either the current or succeeding criteria must be met.

**Notes:**

- The criteria specified under **Show rows with value that** are additive with respect to the filtered values specified by the check boxes, that is, when both sections are used to define a filter, they make the filter more

restrictive.

- The criteria specified under **Show rows with value that** may not work as expected for certain values of the Nominal Diameter property.
- When specifying three or more criteria, it is recommended that you avoid using complex combinations of **And** or **Or** operators to prevent unwanted results of the filtering.
- Click

to add a row for a new criterion below the current criterion.

(Not available for the first criterion row.)

- Click the

beside the string used to specify the value of the criterion to

clear that value.

- Click

to delete the entire row containing the criterion. (Not available

for the first two criteria rows.)

**Pagination**

When displaying data rows in the **Engineering Data Editor**, there is a setting that limits the number of data rows that can be displayed in the EDE view. If the number of rows in the EDE view exceeds this number, the software creates additional pages for the display of the data. Reducing the number of rows displayed per page improves performance when displaying, filtering, sorting, or searching data rows.

You can set the number of rows to display per page in the **Rows per page** box. Type a number between 5 and 3000 and press **Enter** or **Tab** to set the value. Use the navigation controls to move back and forth between pages or to go to the first or last page. To go to a particular page, type the number of that page in the box and press the **Enter** key.

**Notes:**

226 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

- Whenever you open a session of the Smart P&ID Modeler, the number of rows per page is set to 500 by default; however, you can change this

number to any value between 5 and 3000.

- If you change the value in the Rows per page box and you make other

changes in the EDE, clicking the Refresh button

also sets the new

value.

When pagination is applied to the EDE, you can apply the search to all pages or to the current page only. The search options work as follows with pagination:

- **Current Page** — Displays only the rows from the current page that have matching strings. If there are no matching strings on a particular page, all the rows on that page are displayed.
- **All Pages** — Displays the rows from all the pages that have matching strings.

The rows are displayed in one or more pages corresponding to the total

number of rows with matching strings and the number of rows per page that was set.

**EDE Shortcut Menu**

The **Engineering Data Editor** shortcut menu includes commands that are frequently used in the grid view. To access the shortcut menu, right click in the view.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 227

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

**Copy Command**

The **Copy** command is available in the Shortcut menu as well as the Edit menu in the **Engineering Data Editor**. Selecting **Copy** places the value in the currently selected cell onto the Clipboard so that you can paste it somewhere else. This command does not remove the value from the selected table cell. Values place on the Clipboard remain there until newer values are copied over them.

**Paste Command**

The **Paste** command is available in the Shortcut menu as well as the Edit menu in the **Engineering Data Editor**. Selecting **Paste** places the value from the Clipboard into the selected cell. If the cell is read-only, then the **Paste** command is not available.

You must have previously placed a value on the Clipboard in order to paste it.

**Select All Command**

The **Select All** command is available in the Shortcut menu as well as the Edit menu in the **Engineering Data Editor**. **Select All** chooses all the items in the active **EDE**.

You can create a select set using this command.

**Place Multiple Representation Command**

Sometimes, the same piece of equipment may need to be represented more than once in a Smart P&ID plant perhaps for a detailed or alternate view. A multiple representation (multi-rep) allows the depiction of an item in a detailed or alternate view in another drawing. For example, a large vessel may be depicted in two drawings, one displaying the upper part and the other displaying the lower part of the vessel.

In such cases, you may place multiple representations of the item using the EDE. The **Place Multiple Representation** command, available in the Shortcut menu as well as the Actions menu in the **Engineering Data Editor**, allows you to place a second instance or representation of an equipment item in a second drawing. Representations refer to the model item itself and any multi-reps of that model item. You can only make a single representation of an item in any one drawing. There is only one data record for the representation, meaning that if you change the properties of one item, it is updated in all drawings. Multiple representations are available only for some types of equipment.

**Placing a Multiple Representation in a Drawing**

1. Place a vessel in a drawing.

228 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

1. Enter a value in the **Tag Seq No** (tag sequence number) and **Tag Prefix** fields in the **Properties** window. Note the value for **Item Tag** to locate the equipment easily in EDE.
2. Save and exit the drawing.
3. Open the drawing that will be the target for the multiple representation of the item placed in *step 1*. Make sure the drawing used in *step 1* is closed.
4. Select the item type and click the **Other Drawings**

icon in the EDE to find

the item placed in *step 1*. Use the **Item Tag** to locate the item.

1. Right-click the selected item and select the **Place Multiple Representation** command from the shortcut menu. Alternatively, you can select the item and then select the **Place Multiple Representation** command from the **Actions** menu.
2. Drag the mouse pointer into the drawing view and click the location in the drawing where you want to place the multiple representation.

**Delete Stockpile Item Command**

Smart P&ID uses a stockpile concept to store data that does not currently reside in the drawing, such as certain items deleted from the drawing, off-page connector mates, instrument loops, packages and systems, and imported data. The stockpile may be accessed using the **Engineering** **Data** **Editor**. The **Stockpile** contains items that are visible to all users who are working in the plant. The **Drawing** **Stockpile** contains items accessible only to that drawing. You may click on the **Stockpile** and/or *Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 229

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

**Drawing** **Stockpile** toolbar buttons to view the items in the plant stockpile or the drawing stockpile, respectively.

You can use the **Delete Stockpile Item** command, available in the Shortcut menu as well as the Actions menu in the **Engineering Data Editor**, to remove the stockpile item from the plant model completely. The item and its properties are deleted from the database and can no longer be placed in a drawing, regardless of the settings in Options Manager or Catalog Manager. Most items in the stockpile do not have any relationships and can be deleted.

Plant item groups, for example loops and packages, exist in the stockpile and may have relationships to member items in a drawing or in a stockpile. If the plant item group has members in a drawing and it is deleted, the software shows a message that the plant item group is being referenced and asks for confirmation to delete. If you confirm to delete, the plant item group will be deleted but the drawing items will not be deleted. The reference to the plant item group, such as **Package Item Tag** or **Loop** **Tag**, will be removed from that item.

When an OPC is in the stockpile, its relationship to the partner OPC is maintained.

An OPC can be deleted from the stockpile only if both OPCs in the pair are in the stockpile. When you delete the OPC, its partner is also deleted.

**Notes:**

- For equipment components, the **Engineering Data Editor** view does not include a filter for Item Status = ‘Active’ (unlike other item types).

Therefore, the row corresponding to the item that was deleted from the

stockpile is still shown in the view but becomes read-only after refreshing the **Engineering Data Editor** display; the item is removed from the display only when you close and reopen the drawing.

- After deleting a stockpile item from the model, you can restore it to the stockpile (and then to the drawing) using the **Edit** > **Undo** command on the main menu, unless you have performed one of the actions that clears the Undo buffer.

**Deleting a Stockpile Item**

1. Open a drawing containing a plant stockpile item that you want to delete.
2. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, set the scope of the EDE to plant **Stockpile**.
3. Select the item that you want to remove.
4. From the **Actions** menu in the **Engineering Data Editor**, select the **Delete** **Stockpile Item** command. The item and its properties are deleted from the database and can no longer be placed in a drawing, regardless of the setting in **Options Manager** or the property values specified in **Catalog Manager**.

**Note:**

230 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

- After deleting a stockpile item from the plant model, you can restore it to the plant stockpile (and then to the drawing) by using the **Edit > Undo** command on the main menu, unless you have performed one action that

clears the Undo buffer.

**Move to Different Stockpile Command**

The Move to Different Stockpile command, available in the Shortcut menu as well as the Actions menu in the **Engineering Data Editor**, allows you to move an item from one stockpile to another. For instance, you can move an item from the plant stockpile into the stockpile for the active drawing if you know the item belongs to the drawing but want to place it in the drawing later. Similarly, you can move an item in the drawing stockpile to the plant stockpile so that it can be used in other drawings. You can even move items from one drawing stockpile to another.

Plant item groups, such as packages, safety classes, and so forth, reside in a stockpile with their members frequently residing on drawings. There are no limitations when moving a plant item group from a drawing stockpile to the plant stockpile. However, there are limitations in moving a plant item group from the plant stockpile to a drawing stockpile. You can move plant item groups from the plant stockpile to a drawing stockpile only if all members belong to the drawing of the destination drawing stockpile or if the plant item group does not contain items in any drawing.

**Moving an Item to a Different Stockpile**

1. Click the **Stockpile** icon to view items in the plant stockpile or click the **Active** **Drawing Stockpile** icon in EDE to view items in the stockpile of the active drawing.
2. To move the items from a stockpile, select an item in the EDE and click the **Actions** icon in the EDE.
3. Click the **Move to Different Stockpile** command. This displays the **Move to** **Different Stockpile** dialog box.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 231

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

1. In the Tree view, navigate the plant hierarchy and select the node that displays the drawing that includes the stockpile where you want to move the selected item.
2. In the List view, select the appropriate drawing from a list of available drawings that can accept the selected stockpile item, and click the **OK** button. The item is moved to the destination stockpile.

**Highlight in Drawing Command**

When an item from any drawing in the plant other than the active drawing is selected in the **Engineering Data Editor**, selecting the **Highlight in Drawing** command opens the drawing in which the item appears, zooms in on that item, and highlights it.

If the selected item is in the stockpile of the other drawing, this command opens the other drawing and highlights the entire row for that item in the other drawing’s EDE.

**Notes:**

- If the selected item is in the stockpile of the other drawing, this command opens the other drawing and highlights the entire row for that item in the other drawing’s EDE.
- When the Other Drawings command is used to display a drawing item or stockpile item in another drawing, that drawing opens with the Active

Drawing

and Active Drawing Stockpile

buttons selected and with

the same EDE view type as the original drawing.

**Displaying a Plant Item from Another Drawing**

1. Click **Other Drawings** to display properties of the items that appear in all the non-active drawings in the plant.

**Note:**

232 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

- This option also displays the items in the drawing stockpiles of the other drawings.
- To exclude items in the active drawing from the EDE view, ensure that the **Active Drawing** and **Active Drawing Stockpile** commands are disabled to hide those items. Also if needed, use the column filters to reduce the number of records displayed.
1. In the EDE, select the item you want to display in its drawing.
2. Right-click in any cell for the selected item and on the shortcut menu, click **Highlight in Drawing**.

**Controlling the View in the EDE**

The commands on the **View** menu in the **Engineering Data Editor** window allow you to customize the display or the view of the **EDE**. By specifying display settings, you can use color code to distinguish read-only cells from the cells that allow you to enter new property values or modify existing property values. You can also define the font of the stockpile items according to the stockpile that they are currently in. You can create your own filters to define the contents of the view. You can also create unique layouts with the properties that you want to view, in the order that you want to view them. You can even control the scrolling of the EDE with the **Freeze Panes** command.

**Edit View Dialog Box**

Selecting the **EDE >**  **View > Edit View** command opens the **Edit View** dialog box, which enables you to select the item types, filters, and layouts for the tabular display.

An EDE view is a combination of item type, filter, and layout.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 233

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

**Item type** - This list includes all the item types that you can select, such as equipment or motors. By default, this list displays the value selected in the **Item Type** list on the EDE; however, you can change this. The values in the **Filter** and **Layout** list change based on the value selected in the **Item type** list.

**Filter** - This list includes all the filters that have been saved for the selected item type.

**Layout** - This list includes all the layouts that have been saved for the selected item type. The software includes several default layouts. You can create your own layouts by changing the name of an existing layout and adding or deleting properties. The layouts included with Smart P&ID are **Area Break**, **Drawing**, **Equipment**, **Equipment: Component**, **Equipment: Heat Transfer**, **Equipment: Mechanical**, **Equipment: Other**, **Equipment: Vessel**, **Hydraulic Circuit**, **Instrument**, **Instrument Loop**, **Item Note**, **Nozzle**, **OPC**, **Package**, **Pipe Run**, **Piping** **Component**, **Plant Item**, **Plant Item** **Group Other**, **Representation**, **Safety Class**, **Signal Run**, and **System**.

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

**Plant Editing (Editing Properties in the EDE)**

**Plant Editing** refers to the usage of the default **Engineering Data Editor (EDE)** to manage data for all objects in the plant; objects in both the **active** and **non-active** drawings. **Active** drawing(s) refers to the drawing(s) currently open and visible in the **Design Window**. **Non-active** drawings refer to all other drawings except the currently active drawing.

You can edit read/write properties viewed in the table by selecting a table cell and filling in the appropriate information. To save the information, you must the TAB key or click another cell. If the property has a select list associated with the property, you can choose the value from the select list. If a calculation program is associated, the ellipses (calculation) button is displayed when you click the property cell. You can click the ellipses to activate the calculation program and assign the property value.

You cannot edit cells that show a read-only property or a property that is only automatically generated by validation.

You can select an entire row by clicking the icon in the left-most column of the table.

The contents of cells can be copied to other cells using **Ctrl+C** keys to copy and **Crtl+V** keys to paste the contents. You can right-click and select the Copy and Paste commands, if the cell contents are compatible. The contents of cells can also be deleted. To delete the contents of multiple cells at one time, delete the contents of one cell which will make it blank or null, and then copy the blank or null cell to the other cells.

**Important**

- To enable **Plant Editing**, use the **Enable Plant Editing** setting in **Options** **Manager**. If the **Enable Plant Editing** setting is set to **Yes** in **Options** **Manager**, users can manage data for all objects in the plant using the EDE. If the **Enable Plant Editing** setting is set to **No** in **Options Manager**, users are allowed to edit objects in the active drawing and active drawing stockpile only.
- You can only use the default EDE for **Plant Editing**.
- Customize the display settings of the EDE by using the **View > Display** **Settings** command. This is important for the **Read-only** and **Read/write** properties. By customizing the display, you have a visual representation of the property access level (read-only or read/write) as the access level will change according to the status of drawings (open or closed) in the plant.

**Active and Non-Active Drawings**

For the **active** drawing, you can view and edit the property values using any **Engineering Data Editor** window** **and the** Properties** window. For the other, **non-active** drawings, you can view the property values using any **Engineering Data** **Editor** window. However, you can ONLY use the default **Engineering Data Editor** to edit the property values for the **non-active** drawings.

242 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

**Notes:**

- To view the **non-active** drawings in the EDE, click the **Other Drawings** icon on the EDE toolbar. Selecting this button also displays items in the drawing stockpiles of the other drawings.
- When properties are displayed in the EDE as read/write for a non-active drawing and another user opens that drawing, you will not be able to edit those properties. When you try to edit, the **Changed Data** dialog will appear and display the message, *“The selected item’s information has* *changed since the last query. Database will be requeried.”*  After you click the **OK** button, the EDE will refresh and the properties will display in the EDE view as read-only.
- The automatic update of data does not update the sort order. For example, changing the **Fluid Code** of connected pipe runs may result in validation changing the Pipe Run Item Tags. If the EDE layout is sorted by the **Pipe** **Run Item Tag**, the sort order will not update as the Item Tags are changed. To update the sort order, you need to click the **Refresh** button.
- Editing objects in **non-active** drawings renders the drawing out-of-date with respect to model items. However, the database contains the current data and any reports generated will also contain the current data. You

should update the drawing prior to printing from Drawing Manager by

running Update or opening the drawing. (Opening the drawing in Smart

P&ID will update the graphics.)

- The Undo buffer for the active drawing is cleared when editing **non-active** drawings in the EDE.
- The **Undo** command is not available when editing **non-active** drawings.

**Batch Copy and Paste Item Properties**

This option applies to where cell contents are compatible.

1. On the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar, choose an item type from the select list, for example, **Pipe Run**.
2. Select the scope for the display of the data (**Active Drawing**, **Other Drawings**, stockpiles).
3. If desired, apply a filter to display only the data rows where you want to copy data.
4. Right-click in the field from which you want to copy data and on the shortcut menu, click **Copy**.
5. Select the field to which you want to copy data, or hold down **Shift** while selecting several consecutive fields in a column.
6. Right-click, and on the shortcut menu, click **Paste**.

**Notes:**

- If you use Plant Editing to change a property value in a non-active

drawing, propagation occurs according to the System Editing rules defined for the plant and the **Engineering Data Editor** display is automatically updated. This includes propagation of data between non-active drawings

across Off-Page Connectors (OPCs) when both drawings involved are not

opened by a user. Propagation does not occur across OPCs between the

active drawing and a non-active drawing.

- If a property value in the **Engineering Data Editor** is changed by the user or as a result of an automatic update and this property is used for sorting, the software does not update the sort order of the data automatically if the values are no longer in the correct order. To update the sort order, the user must refresh the **Engineering Data Editor** display manually.

**Batch Replace Units of Measure Properties**

This option applies to where cell contents have identical values and units of measure.

1. On the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar, choose an item type from the select list, for example, **Pipe Run**.
2. Select the scope for the display of the data (**Active Drawing**, **Other Drawings**, stockpiles).
3. If desired, apply a filter to display only the data rows with identical values and units of measure.

244 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor*

1. Select a field with the desired value, and from the list, select an alternative format.

**Note:**

- The value changes to the equivalent value in the new units of measure; for example, 50 psi becomes 2.4 bar g.
1. You can also change to a different format for the same units of measure; for example, where 50 psi becomes 50.254 psi.
2. Right-click in the field from which you want to copy data and on the shortcut menu, click **Copy**.
3. Select the field to which you want to copy data, or hold down **Shift** while selecting several consecutive fields in a column.
4. Right-click, and on the shortcut menu, click **Paste**.

**Notes:**

- The software copies the equivalent value in the new units of measure to all the selected fields.
- If you use Plant Editing to change a unit of measure value in a non-active drawing, propagation occurs according to the System Editing rules defined for the plant and the **Engineering Data Editor** display is automatically updated. This includes propagation of data between non-active drawings

across Off-Page Connectors (OPCs) when both drawings involved are not

opened by a user. Propagation does not occur across OPCs between the

active drawing and a non-active drawing.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 245

*System Editing*

**System Editing**

When **System Editing** is enabled for a plant, changed property values are automatically spread or propagated to related items according to the currently defined consistency criteria. In certain cases, you may want to set a property value on one item only and not allow it to be propagated to any related items. Therefore, you can temporarily turn off **System Editing**.

**System Editing Command**

The **Tools > System Editing** command controls propagation of property values between connected items. If you select **System Editing** from the Tools menu, a checkmark displays by the command, and the command is active. When the command is active and you make additions or changes to a drawing, the changes are propagated according to relationships and rules.

**Note:**

- You can also select the **System Editing**

icon from the main toolbar.

The **System Editing** command is always turned on when you start a design session if it is enabled. Using the **System Editing** command, you can also turn off propagation temporarily during a design session. After the change has been made, you can use the same command to turn **System Editing** on again. **System Editing** can be enabled or disabled for the entire plant through the **Enable System Editing** setting in **Options** **Manager**.

**Notes:**

- If the **Enable System Editing** setting is set to **Yes** in Options Manager, then every P&ID drawing in the plant will have **System Editing** enabled by default upon entering a design session. If the **Enable System Editing** setting is set to **No** in **Options Manager**, **System Editing** cannot be enabled in Smart P&ID. Disabling **System Editing** in **Options Manager** is not recommended because the drawing cannot be validated.
- You can turn **System Editing** off but later when you turn it on, it does not attempt to propagate any prior changes made.
- **System Editing** is not supported from or to plant item groups such as loops and packages.

246 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*System Editing*

**The Scope of System Editing**

The scope of **System Editing** is determined by connectivity and the rules and relationships in **Rule Manager**:

- **Connectivity** – All items that are connected to the selected item are candidates for inclusion in the propagation process.
- **Rules** – The consistency criteria specified in the rules define which property values are propagated and in which direction. The propagation scope can be expanded across a relationship if there is an applicable rule for the property being modified.
- **Inconsistencies** – The propagation scope is not expanded past an existing inconsistency for the property being modified. Using the **System Editing** command does not automatically resolve an inconsistency. You must resolve the inconsistency.
- **Breaks (Break Labels)** – Propagation breaks can be defined for specified properties at specified relationships in a design. The propagation scope is not expanded past a break for the property being modified. For this reason, it could be helpful to place the breaks at an early stage of the data input process.
- **Break Components** – Components can be defined with an option to break the nominal diameter or with a filter defining other specified properties that will break at that item. The propagation scope is not expanded past a break component for the property being modified.
- **Plant Editing** – Property values that are edited in the **EDE** using **Plant Editing** will propagate through **System Editing** according to the** **rules defined for the plant. For a non-active drawing, the propagation of data occurs across OPCs to other non-active drawings when all the connected drawings are closed (not currently open by *any* user on *any* machine). The updated data will display automatically in the EDE for all the drawings without any need to use the** Refresh** command. For an active drawing, the propagation of data occurs within the active drawing only. Data will not propagate beyond the active drawing boundary to other drawings through OPCs. An active drawing is in a locked state, and any changes made in a non-active drawing will not propagate data back across OPCs into the active drawing.
- **Highlighting** – When modifying a certain property either by clicking in a property field in the **Properties** window or by choosing a solution in the **Consistency Check Solutions** list, all items included in the modification are highlighted so that the user can view the scope of the items for which the property value will be changed. This scope can vary according to the property being modified.

**Note**:

- When making a graphical selection of a pipe route, initially only the connector piece of a pipe run is highlighted. However, because the data is stored by pipe *Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 247

*System Editing*

run, even if **System Editing** is turned off, the entire pipe run will highlight.

To see how far a pipe run extends, you can turn **System Editing** off and click on any property for that pipe run in the **Properties** window. Smart P&ID will highlight the entire pipe run.

When an item is placed from **Catalog Explorer** or the **Stockpile** and connected to an existing item or an existing item is modified, a new relationship is created and property values are copied and propagated across the new relationship as specified in the rules. However, **System Editing** does not copy and propagate the property values across the relationship if property values already exist unless one item contains a **Null** property value. For example, if the endpoint handle of an existing pipe run is dragged and dropped onto an existing piping component, propagation is initiated. Consistency checking is performed at the new relationship and any differences in property values are displayed as inconsistencies; the existing property values are not automatically changed to match unless one of the values is set to **Null**.

The propagation of property values is as follows:

- **Properties** - The property values that can propagate across this relationship are of those properties that are listed as consistency criteria in all applicable rules.
- **Copy and Propagate -** A property value can be copied in either direction across the new relationship and is propagated outward.

**Modifying a Property Value with System Editing Turned On**

1. Enable System Editing, and then select **Tools >**  **System Editing** to see if there is a check mark beside it.
2. Select an item in the drawing.
3. In the **Properties** window, click a property for the selected item to modify it.
4. Enter the updated value for the selected property. When you start modifying the value of the property, all items connected to the selected item are highlighted and the changes to the property value propagate to all of them. The propagation depends on the item and the property selected.

248 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*System Editing*

**Note:**

- If you modify the property of an item and **System Editing** is turned off, no other items are highlighted.
1. Select the **System Editing** command from the **Tools** menu to turn **System** **Editing** off.

**Modifying a Property Value Using Plant Editing**

**Important**

- Make sure the **Plant Editing** setting in **Options Manager** is set to **Yes** to enable **Plant Editing**.
- The active drawing is in a locked state, and any changes made in a non-active drawing do not propagate data back across OPCs into the active drawing. If you want to propagate data to all drawings in the plant, create and open a blank drawing. This will make all the drawings in the plant non-active and will include them in the scope of data propagation through connected OPCs.
1. Enable System Editing, and then select **Tools >**  **System Editing** to see if there is a check mark beside it.
2. Open the default **Engineering Data Editor** window and select an item type from the **Item Type** pull-down list.
3. Click the **Other Drawings** icon to display the items and their properties in the non-active drawings.

**Note:**

- Selecting the **Other Drawings** icon also displays items in the drawing stockpile of the other drawings.
1. Edit the data in the fields according to the type of data:
- For text, select the field and just type the desired value.
- For a list of values (or equivalent quantitative values with different units of measure), double-click the field and select the desired value from the pulldown list.
- For a field with the **Calculation** button (ellipses), double-click the field and then click the ellipses to open a dialog box.

**Consistency Checking**

Consistency checking verifies the suitability of work that a designer performs while creating the drawing. The software verifies, in real-time, if the composition of a drawing and the underlying data model satisfies rules that your company has defined.

The software includes pre-defined standard industry design propagation. For *Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 249

*System Editing*

example, pipe runs inherit properties from nozzles. Additional consistency checking and design propagation are defined in Rule Manager.

Consistency checking continuously monitors your work when you change or add items to a drawing. Smart P&ID displays all the inconsistencies, and the **Consistency** **Check** dialog box describes specific problems and offers hints. You can use these to decide the best method to resolve an inconsistency.

**Notes:**

- You can display the **Consistency Check** dialog box by right-clicking an inconsistency indicator and selecting the** Consistency Check** command.
- You can also display the **Consistency Check** dialog box by selecting the **Consistency Check** command from the **Edit** menu. When the **Consistency** **Check** dialog box appears, Smart P&ID automatically selects the first item in the list. Other sections** **of the dialog box provide details that are specifically related to the selected inconsistency**. **

**Consistency Check Dialog Box**

The **Consistency Check** dialog box appears when you display the properties of an inconsistency indicator. This dialog box lists the inconsistencies, their specific problem area, and solutions for resolving the inconsistencies. The dialog box also displays the consistency criteria and propagation breaks that apply at the selected relationship indicator.

There are two tabs in the **Consistency Check** dialog box, **Inconsistencies** and **Consistency Criteria**. All inconsistencies that occur at a junction, regardless of the severity, are listed on the** Inconsistencies** tab. When you select an inconsistency from the list, Smart P&ID displays information specific to that inconsistency in the **Solutions** section. A specific example of this type can involve data inconsistencies for nominal pipe diameter, normal operating temperature, and alternate design pressure between a piping component and pipe run. This represents three different problems at the same junction. All the properties that are compared by consistency checking and copied across the selected connection due to propagation are shown on the **Consistency** tab.

- The **Item 1** field displays the item type and item tag for the first item that is connected by the active relationship.
- The **Relationship** pull-down menu displays the number for the active relationship and allows you to select the relationship to be reviewed. The drop-down list contains a number for each relationship that exists at the selected point. The graphic relationship indicator that corresponds to the number shown in this control is highlighted.
- The **Item 2** field displays the item type and item tag for the second item that is connected by the active relationship.
- The **Highlight item 1** checkbox helps you to locate the item in the drawing.

Selecting the checkbox highlights the item in the drawing. By default, this option is not selected.

- The **Highlight item 2** checkbox helps you to locate the item in the drawing.

Selecting the checkbox highlights the item in the drawing. By default, this option is not selected.

**Note:**

- The **Item 1** field, **Relationship** pull-down menu, **Item 2** field, and the **Highlight item 1** and **Highlight item 2** checkboxes are also available when you choose the **Consistency Criteria** tab.

The **Inconsistencies** tab displays the inconsistencies at the selected relationship. For each inconsistency, the status, severity, and description are displayed. The icons used in the status column are the same as the icons used for inconsistencies in the Drawing View. The first inconsistency in the list is automatically selected. However, you can select any of the inconsistencies using a mouse click or the arrow keys.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 251

*System Editing*

- The **Description** field displays the actual error or warning. For a lengthy error or warning, a tooltip appears to reveal the entire description. You cannot change the inconsistency description; it is provided only for information.
- The **Solutions** list displays the list of available solutions for the selected inconsistency. Some of the solutions copy a property value across the relationship and initiate propagation.
- The **Apply** button executes the solution selected from the **Solutions** section. The inconsistencies are re-evaluated after executing the solution and the dialog box is updated.

The **Consistency Criteria** tab shows all the properties to be compared and copied at the selected relationship. These consistency criteria come from the rules that apply to the selected relationship. The consistency criteria for each rule are originally specified within **Rule Manager.**  The name of the source rule is shown in the first column. The remaining columns are the same as shown in the **Consistency** tab of the **Rule** **Properties** dialog box in **Rule Manager**. Single selection mode is supported.

- The **Rule Name** field displays the name of the rule.
- The **Item 1 Property** field displays the name of the **Item 1** property to be copied and/or compared. Only those properties that are listed are copied or propagated across the relationship and compared (consistency checked) to the value in the related item.
- The **Copy** field displays the copy action to be performed. This column controls how the property value is propagated when a change is made.

The following table describes the possible values and their meanings:

**System Editing and Consistency Checking: Inconsistencies**

System Editing never expands across an inconsistency for the property being propagated. For a given set of connected items with a consistent property value, System Editing allows you to easily change that value to a new value. However, if the items are not consistent to begin with (inconsistencies exist), then System Editing will not automatically make them consistent. Other tools are available (such as **Solutions** on the **Consistency Check** dialog box) for resolving inconsistencies.

**System Editing and Consistency Checking: Break**

**Components**

Some components inherently limit the copying and suppress the consistency checking of certain properties. For example, a reducer is a break component for the **Nominal** **Diameter** property. When changing the **Nominal Diameter** in a pipeline, the spread of that change is limited by any reducers that exist in that pipeline. The consistency checking that would normally be done between the connected pipes is also suppressed at the reducer.

**System Editing and Consistency Checking: Break Labels**

A property break is a point in a connected network of items where a property value changes. You can define a property break by placing a break label. A property break is an exception to the consistency criteria defined in a rule. A property break defines a limitation to the spread of the propagation scope. The rules provide the general definition of the scope, while the property breaks provide specific limitations of the scope.

The **Consistency Check** dialog box shows the consistency criteria at the selected relationship indicator, which includes all the properties that are copied and compared across that connection. When you place a break label, the **Copy** and **Compare** columns show icons that indicate that no copy and compare operations are performed for the properties in the label.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 257

*System Editing*

The consistency criteria specified in the rules define the general behavior of the properties. Break labels provide a way to define exceptions to the general rules. A break label provides a visible and plottable symbol that signifies the end of one property value condition and the beginning of a new condition along a pipe. A changed property value is never propagated across a break label for that property. A break label also suppresses consistency checking for the property it breaks. A break label can break one or more properties.

**Note:**

- You must put the break labels at the beginning of the design phase. This will break the propagation and suppress the inconsistencies from the start.

Break labels can be placed directly from **Catalog Explorer**. A break label can only be placed at the endpoint of a graphical pipe line where it connects to a component or a branch point. A break label can only be placed at a connection point where the specified properties are being propagated and where the specified properties are listed 258 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*System Editing*

in the consistency criteria for the applicable rules. When a break label is placed interactively, the corresponding property break data is added to the relationship object. The break label stays attached to the point it was placed on and cannot be dragged away from it.

Break labels can be deleted in the standard way using the **Delete** command. When a break label is deleted, the break is removed from the relationship object. However, if another break label (that also breaks this property) exists at this same point, the break would not be removed.

**System Editing and Consistency Checking: OPCs**

You can effectively propagate a changed property value across drawing boundaries. If a changed property value is propagated and it reaches an OPC, it simply stops at that point. An inconsistency indicator at the OPC shows that the value in the active drawing is inconsistent with the value on the connected pipe in the continuation drawing.

Double-clicking the inconsistency indicator displays the **Consistency Check** dialog box, which helps to resolve the inconsistency. One of the solutions available for resolving inconsistencies is to copy the property value from the continuation drawing to the active drawing. When this is done, the property value from the pipe run in the continuation drawing is copied to the pipe run in the active drawing and the property value spreads outward from there, according to the standard propagation rules. Thus, property values can be propagated across drawing boundaries.

An **OPC** can be placed as a freestanding item in a drawing or it can be placed onto an existing pipe run. If an **OPC** has been placed as a freestanding item, a pipe run can be attached to it. When the relationship between the **OPC** and the **pipe run** is created (either by placing the OPC or by placing the pipe run), the system finds the applicable rules, copies the specified properties, and evaluates the consistency criteria.

When the first **OPC** (of an **OPC** pair) is connected to a pipe run, there is no pipe run connected to the partner OPC. Since there is no other pipe run**,**  the system does not find any applicable rules. When the partner **OPC** (of an **OPC** pair) is connected to a pipe run**,**  the system finds the rules that apply to the pair of pipe runs. The system copies the specified properties from the pipe run in the other drawing to the **pipe run** in the active drawing. This copy operation does not overwrite any existing values.

The **Copy** is forced into the **Copy If Null** mode.

The properties that are copied across the **OPC** are propagated into the active drawing.

This can mean that property values on items other than the connected **pipe run** are affected. However, this is only done if the current value is **Null**. Existing values are not overwritten. After the copy process is complete, the consistency criteria are evaluated and **inconsistencies** are generated for all inconsistent properties. Property values are not automatically copied across **OPCs** during this processing. To copy changed property values across **OPCs**, use the solutions that are available in the **Consistency Check** dialog box.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 259

*System Editing*

Each time a drawing is opened, a routine is executed to update all the **OPCs** in that drawing. In addition, the relationship between the **OPC** and the connected pipe run is updated. During this update, the rule base is searched to find all of the applicable rules. If the partner **OPC** has been connected to a new pipe run since the last time the drawing was opened, it may find a separate set of rules that apply. The text in the label on the **OPC** is also updated. If the partner **OPC** has been placed in a different drawing since the last time this drawing was opened, this change will be reflected in the updated label**.**

For** System Editing** to properly propagate data across **OPCs** using **Plant Editing** from a **non-active** drawing to other connected, **non-active** drawings in the Plant, a relationship between the **OPC** and the continuing pipe run must be established. When the first **OPC** of the pair is placed and connected to a pipe run, there is no relationship because the partner **OPC** has not yet been placed. After the partner **OPC** is placed and connected to a pipe run** **in the other drawing, a relationship is established because the** OPC** knows about its partner **OPC** and the continuing pipe run. This placement of the partner **OPC** does not automatically refresh the first **OPC** placed. To fully update the relationships, you must close and reopen the drawing containing the first **OPC**.

**System Editing and Changing Property Values Across OPCs**

When a property value is changed on a pipe run that is connected to an **OPC**, the connected pipe run in the continuation drawing should be changed in a corresponding manner. You can achieve this result with a workflow that allows you to *pull* a changed property value across an **OPC** into the continuation drawing. When a property value is changed on a pipe run that is connected to an **OPC**, an inconsistency is generated at the **OPC**. This **inconsistency** indicates that the two connected pipes have different values.

To resolve this inconsistency, you must close the active drawing and open the continuation drawing. In the continuation drawing, which is now the active drawing, another inconsistency will be shown at the partner **OPC**. You can double-click the inconsistency to display the **Consistency Check** dialog box. A solution is displayed to **Copy** the new value from the other drawing onto the pipe run in the active drawing. If you apply this solution, the value is copied into the active drawing and propagated to the related items. The **inconsistency** is resolved. The next time you open the other drawing, the inconsistency will be resolved there as well.

*Item Tag Validation*

**Item Tag Validation**

**Item Tag** **Validation** is delivered with Smart P&ID as *ItemTag.dll* and performs calculations and validations for unique tag checking, automatic tag generation, and tag reformatting. **Item Tag** **Validation** checks the active plant for existing and duplicate item tags, and generates unique **Item Tag** values. It maintains consistency between the **Item Tag** value and the properties used in its calculation and removes any trailing or embedded spaces (only for properties included in the item tag).

**Notes:**

- The source code for the delivered *ItemTag.dll*  is also delivered with Smart P&ID and it can be customized. ** **
- As an alternative to the delivered **Item Tag Validation**, there is a customizable **Item Tag** **Configuration** utility available in the Smart P&ID

**Support Utilities**. The **Item Tag** **Configuration** utility allows virtually any naming convention to be configured for the **Item Tag**. ** **

**Item Tag** **Validation** deals specifically with the following item types: instrument loops, instruments, pipe runs, equipment components, signal runs with a plant item type of **Pipe** **Run** (hydraulic, connect to process, and so forth), equipment (other equipment, exchangers, mechanical equipment, and vessels), and nozzles. **Item Tag** **Validation** disregards all other item types.

**Triggering Validation and Calculation**

Property validation is triggered when any property that comprises the **Item Tag** value is added or modified. Calculation is triggered by the **Item Tag** property for any of the items shown in the following table.

This table lists the item types, which are validated or calculated by the **Item Tag** **Validation**, and the database tables and property names, where modifications trigger validation and calculation.

**Table Legend:**

- *Italics* - Required for checking **Item Tag** uniqueness.
- ***Bold Italics*** - Required for the **Item Tag**, but can be generated automatically.

**Notes:**

- The **Item Tag** field for the instrument’s implied items is not read-only; you can manually assign item tags to them.
- When you define the **Tag Suffix** property for **Instrument Loop**, the calculation program will automatically generate the **Tag Sequence Number** and format the value together with the **Measured Variable Code** and** Instr** **Type Modifier** to generate the **Item Tag** property.

262 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Item Tag Validation*

- When you define the **Fluid Code** property for a **Pipe Run**, the calculation program generates the **Tag Sequence Number** and formats the value together with the **Unit Code**, **Tag Seq No**, and **Fluid Code** to generate the **Item Tag** property.
- When you define the **Tag Prefix** property for **Equipment** in a P&ID, the calculation program automatically creates the next **Tag Seq No** and formats the values together to generate the **Item Tag** property.
- The **Tag Seq No** for **Nozzles** are generated per equipment item and **Tag** **Prefix**. When you define the **Tag Prefix** property for a nozzle in a P&ID, the calculation program automatically starts with a **Tag Seq No** of 1, and formats the values together with **Tag Suffix** to generate the **Item Tag**. The **Item Tag** is unique with respect to the **Tag Prefix** and **Tag Seq No** properties. Each unique prefix will start the numbering at 1. For example, if you assign nozzles with a **Tag Prefix** of **N** and then assign a manway (which is also a nozzle) the **Tag Prefix** of **M**, the items with a prefix of **N** will start numbering on that piece of equipment with **1** and the items with the prefix of** M** will also start numbering on that piece of equipment with **1**.

With the automatic item tag generation feature, the next available number is selected from **Options Manage**r, and the values in **Options Manager** are incremented to reflect the change. If you choose to input the **Tag Seq No** information in the field, Smart P&ID checks for duplicate values when the item tag is generated. If an item tag already exists with that value, a message about duplicate tags is displayed, confirming if you want the next available sequence number. You can choose **Yes** to generate the next available sequence number or **No** to manually create a unique value.

When an off-page connector is placed in a drawing, the **OPC Tag** is automatically generated based on the next available sequence number from **Options Manager**. The partner OPC is automatically placed in the plant stockpile with the same **OPC Tag**, unless you have deselected the **Place partner OPC in stockpile** checkbox in the **Placement** tab of the **Options** dialog box, which can be accessed by selecting the **Options** command from the **Tools** menu.

**Triggering Item Tag Validation to Generate Item Tags**

11. In the **Engineering Data Editor** window, select **Instrument Loop** from the **Item** **Type** pull-down list and define a **Tag Suffix** for the loop. Then, click another field. The tag for the **Loop Number** is automatically generated.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 265

*Using Piping Specification Access*

**Using Piping Specification Access**

The **Piping Specification** (**PipeSpec**) utility works with PDS 3D, Smart 3D, or Smart Reference Data to validate the piping materials class with the temperatures, pressures, and diameters assigned to the pipe run and to search commodity codes (in all product databases) and fabrication categories (in PDS

3D only) for inline piping components. The database tables and library files in the 3D product provide source information for the validation and search.

In **Data Dictionary Manager**, the *ValidateNomDiam.ForeignCalc* program ID, which is assigned to the **Nominal Diameter** property, starts the **PipeSpec** utility and triggers the commodity code and fabrication category lookups when the **Nominal Diameter** property value is changed.

**Notes:**

- You will need to assign Validation and Calculation Program IDs for all relevant properties and configure settings in **Options Manager** in order to utilize the **PipeSpec** utility in Smart P&ID. For more information about assigning program IDs, see **Data Dictionary**

**Manager Help**.

- Error messages are placed in the *PipeSpecError.log* file in the directory assigned to the *TEMP* environment variable. Error messages help you identify the cause of failure when the utility does not complete the

tasks as expected. For example, if the minimum requirements are not

met for the lookup, the missing properties are listed in the log file.

**Performing Service Limits Validation**

The **PipeSpec** utility verifies that the temperatures and pressures assigned to a pipe run comply with the service limits associated with the selected **Piping** **Materials Class**. In the continuous validation mode, this verification occurs each time you modify either the **Piping Materials Class** or a temperature–

pressure pair in the process case data of the pipe run. **Service Limits** **Validation** requires at least one complete temperature-pressure pair from the design, alternate design, operating, and alternate operating cases.

**Notes**:

- If any temperature-pressure pair violates the service limits of the

selected **Piping Materials Class**, the **Service Limit Validation** dialog box is displayed with a warning showing the appropriate pairs. This

warning appears in the design software by appending an error string to

the name of the piping materials class (PMC).

266 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Using Piping Specification Access*

---

- The **Commodity Code** property shows an error, *ERROR in PMC.*
- The **Piping Materials Class** property shows a service limit error.
- The *ServiceLimits.log* file contains any errors encountered during **Service Limits Validation**, which runs as part of the **PipeSpec** utility.
- **Service Limits Validation** and the automatic commodity code lookup can be disabled simultaneously using a switch in **Options Manager**.

For more information on configuring the **Piping Specification** settings, see **Options Manager Help**.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 267

*Using Piping Specification Access*

**Performing Commodity Code and Fabrication Category**

**Lookup**

The **PipeSpec** utility looks up the **Commodity Code** property (in all product databases) and **Fabrication** **Category** property (in PDS 3D database only) of inline piping components. In the continuous validation mode, this lookup occurs each time the **Piping Materials Class** or any of the case temperatures: **Design Max Temp**, **Design Min Temp**, **Operating Max Temp**, or **Operating Min Temp** are modified on the pipe run (for **Smart Reference** **Data**, only changes in the **Piping Materials Class** or **Design Max Temp** initiate the look-up) are modified on the pipe run. Validation also occurs every time the **Option Code** or **Nominal Diameter** of the component is modified. If the property value on the piping component is modified, the lookup is

restricted to that particular component. However, if the property value on the pipe run is modified, the lookup encompasses all piping components on that pipe run.

**Note:**

- The minimum requirements for a lookup are:

o The piping component must be in a pipe run.

o The PMC of the pipe run must be populated and must comply with

the service limits.

o The nominal diameter of the piping component must be specified.

If you subsequently assign nominal diameters to in-line valves or other components, Smart P&ID assigns them commodity codes (in all produce databases) and fabrication categories (in PDS 3D database only) that

corresponding to the piping materials class of the pipe run and the

specifications in the 3D databases.

If you modify the **Nominal Diameter** property of a component and the commodity code is not available for this component type with the given

diameter size and the corresponding piping specifications, the value of the **Commodity Code** for that component changes to **Not in Spec**.

268 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Using Piping Specification Access*

The **PipeSpec** utility uses process case temperatures of the pipe run during the commodity code lookup only if the code for that component has a maximum temperature limit value in the 3D database. For example, in PDS 3D, a value of -9999 for maximum temperature in *pdtable_202*  indicates a null value and the process case temperatures on the pipe run are ignored for the lookup. If a maximum temperature exists for that component, the lookup ensures this value is greater than all of the process case temperatures assigned to the pipe run, in which the piping component resides.

**Note:**

- The units for the PDS 3D maximum temperature are specified in

**Options Manager**.

If any temperature values for the pipe run are unspecified, a value of zero Deg-K is assumed for each of the unspecified temperatures. If multiple records are obtained in the lookup, the utility returns a commodity code only if all of the records have the same code value. If not, an error is recorded in the error-log file with the appropriate message.

The **Fabrication Category** property of in-line piping components is a select-listed property in Smart P&ID. A relationship between **Fabrication Category** and **Commodity Name** can be defined in the 3D databases. The** Commodity** **Name** is a unique name for every symbol. In PDS 3D, this unique name is the **AABBCC Code** property. Smart symbols are assigned the same **AABBCC**

**Code** properties in **Catalog Manager**.

Similarly, the **Option Code** property is a select list of text values in Smart P&ID and a set of code numbers or indices in PDS 3D. **Short Value** for the **Option Code** select list contains the PDS 3D indices corresponding to the appropriate **Option Code** text in Smart P&ID. The **PipeSpec** utility uses the entries in the **Short Value** box of the **Option Code** list to obtain the **Option** **Code** used in the PDS 3D database tables.

1. Place a pipe run and enter values for the Piping Materials Class and Nominal Diameter properties.
2. From **Catalog Explorer**, place an in-line component such as a valve on the pipe run.
3. Notice the **Commodity Code** assigned to the valve in the **Properties** window. You can also add a label from **Catalog Explorer** to display the commodity code in the drawing.

270 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Using Piping Specification Access*

**Notes:**

- You can open the error log, *PipeSpecError.log*, if properties have not been assigned as expected.
- Adding or changing the option code can change the commodity code,

if the relationship is defined in your PDS 3D database.

- With appropriate settings in **Options Manager** and **Data Dictionary** **Manager**, you can manually assign commodity codes to in-line

components. The **PipeSpec** utility then looks up accepted diameters and validates the assignment.

- If continuous validation is not activated but other appropriate settings and program IDs are assigned, you can still click the **Calculation**

*Using Insulation Specifications*

**Using Insulation Specifications**

The complex process plants of today require the use of extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, to manufacture the products needed. To make the plants energy efficient and economical and to provide safety to workers, the use of insulation is necessary.

Over the years, company standards have been developed to dictate the type and thickness of insulation based on temperature and other operating factors. These standards make it feasible for the design software to select the proper insulation required and automatically enter it into the database. This practice enhances the quality and speed of the design process by freeing users from the laborious and error-prone task of entering property data.

Detailed insulation thickness calculations are necessary for each pipeline and piece of equipment in a plant. However, since insulation typically comes in a standard thickness, companies usually generate tables of data that match the thickness required versus temperature and diameter. Different tables are generated for different conditions, for example, personnel protection or energy conservation.

Smart P&ID **Insulation (Specification) Manager** provides users with a way to enter their table data such that it is electronically stored and accessed by the software, as required. The software performs the table lookups so that users do not need to spend valuable time looking through stacks of insulation tables.

**Insulation Specification Access**

Insulation specifications are stored in a file with an . *isl* extension. The delivered file is called *InsulationSpec.isl*. A pointer to this file is located in the **Settings** in **Options** **Manager**. In Smart P&ID, you can use **Insulation Specification Access** to select the **Insulation Spec** value for piping and/or equipment:

- For **Piping,**  the software uses **Insulation Temperature** and **Nominal Diameter** combined with the selected **Insulation Specification** to retrieve an **Insulation** **Purpose, Thickness**, **Type**, and **Density** from the lookup table.
- For **Equipment**, the software uses **Insulation Temperature** combined with the selected **Insulation Specification** to retrieve **Insulation Purpose, Thickness**, **Type**, and **Density** from the lookup table.

**Assigning Insulation Specification**

1. Select the pipe run to which you want to add insulation specification.
2. Click the **Nominal Diameter** field in the **Properties** window and select the appropriate value from the pull-down list.

272 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Using Insulation Specifications*

**Note:**

- If the **Insulation Nominal Diameter** is specified, the calculation will ignore the **Nominal Diameter** and use the **Insulation Nominal Diameter** property for the lookup.
1. Click the **Insulation Spec** field in the **Properties** window. This displays the **Calculation** button.
2. Click the **Calculation** button to display the **Insulation Spec** dialog box.

The **Insulation Spec** dialog box includes two sections:

- **Matching** – Lists all insulation specifications that match the values already selected, such as **Insulation Type** or **Insulation Purpose**.
- **All** – Lists all the insulation specifications in the plant insulation specification file.
1. Select an appropriate value from the list in the **Matching** section and click the **OK** button. When the value for **Insulation Spec** is specified, the values for **Insulation Purpose**, **Insulation Density**, and **Insulation Type** are automatically assigned.

**Notes:**

- If you have already specified other insulation properties, such as

**Insulation Type** or **Insulation Purpose**, the **Matching** list will contain only the insulation specifications that agree with the properties already selected. In such cases, you can choose a specification from the **All** list, if required. Selecting a specification from the **All** list will change the insulation property values to match the value defined by **Insulation**

**Specification**.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 273

*Using Insulation Specifications*

- Assigning heat tracing to an item before assigning the insulation properties restricts the choices available for insulation properties and specifications.
1. In the **Insulation Temp** field in the **Properties** window, specify the appropriate value. The values for **Insulation Thk** (thickness) and **Insulation Thk Source** are automatically assigned.

**Notes:**

- Normally, when using the insulation lookup function, Smart P&ID

determines an insulation thickness. The **Insulation Thk Source** property tracks whether the software or the user set the insulation thickness. If the user decides to override the thickness provided by the software, the value of **Insulation Thk Source** is changed to **User**.

- If the value of the temperature or diameter falls outside the range of the **Insulation Specification**, an error message is displayed stating, ‘ *The* *temperature or diameter value falls outside the range of the insulation* *specification. Please enter another value.* ’ When you click the **OK** button on this message box, the system reverts to the original value.

The reports available in Smart P&ID allow you to retrieve information from the database and display the data as formatted output. At any time during the design creation process, you can generate reports. Each report consists of a Microsoft®

Excel workbook and a report definition, which specifies the data that will be collected and the way the data will be organized in the workbook.

Reports are based on specific item types, such as equipment, nozzle, and instrument.

The item type serves as the starting point for collecting data for a report. Each report contains at least one report item to define the item type for the report. For example, a report based on the equipment item type contains a report item named **Equipment**.

This report item ensures the properties associated with each piece of equipment are available for inclusion in the report. However, you do not have to include every available property in the report if it is not appropriate. You can define additional report items to access more properties for more item types. For example, a nozzle report item can be added to access data about nozzles because nozzles and equipment are related.

The location of a report item in the tree hierarchy affects the properties that are collected for the associated item type. For example, if a nozzle is added as the top-level item in the tree, all nozzles in the database are included in the report. If the nozzle is added as a child of **Equipment: Mechanical**, only the information about nozzles that are associated with pumps is included.

Several default reports and templates are delivered with Smart P&ID, but you can also create your own, fully customized reports. To create customized reports, you can either use one of the existing templates or start with a blank template. You can create customized reports for your own personal use, but you need proper permissions in SPEM to create plant reports, which are available for use by all users.

**Note:**

- ** **Excel must be installed on your computer in order to generate and display reports.

**Reports Menu**

The** Reports** menu allows you to create new reports, edit or delete existing report templates, or generate reports.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 281

*Printing Drawings*

**Printing Drawings**

You can print your drawings on many different devices ranging from dot

matrix printers to laser printers and plotters. Except for the color settings and a few special effects, the drawing prints exactly as it appears in the Drawing View. This stipulation applies to special settings like the display of

inconsistency indicators or filtered items.

**Print Command in Smart P&ID**

As you work on a drawing, you can use the **Print** command on the **File** menu to send a copy of the active drawing to a specified printer, plotter, or file. The currently active view (Primary, Typical, or Both) will print. You can also use the **Print** command to:

- Print an entire drawing or specific views from a drawing.
- Set printing options, such as the range of sheets or number of copies to print.

Smart P&ID supports plotting using standard Windows® plotting capabilities.

It also supports pen plotters, subject to the limitations of the device driver.

Items look the same on the screen and in the printed drawing. However, the fonts you select can affect the match between what you see on the screen and what appears on the printed page. Three kinds of fonts affect your work:

- Scalable Fonts – Use scalable fonts, such as TrueType® fonts, to make sure that what you see on the screen is what appears on the printed page.
- Printer Fonts – If you use printer fonts, you must have a corresponding screen font and font size to display each font on the screen.
- Screen Fonts– If each screen font you use has a matching printer font, the screen display of the drawing will closely match the printed drawing.

The **Print** command on the **File** menu opens the **Print** dialog box. This dialog box controls how a drawing is printed. It provides options for defining the printing area, range, number of copies, and other printing characteristics.

Before using the **Print** command, you must install and select a printer.

**Print Dialog Box in Smart P&ID**

The **Print** dialog box in Smart P&ID controls how a drawing is printed and includes four sections: **Printer**, **Print range**, **Options**, and **Copies**.

282 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Printing Drawings*

- **Printer**:

o The **Name** pull-down list allows you to specify the printer that you want to use. You can select from a list of the available configured

printers. The information below the **Name** field applies to the selected printer. The printer that you select in the **Name** field is the default printer for the rest of the current design session until you specify a

different printer.

o The **Properties** button opens the [ ***Printer***]** Properties** dialog box, where ***Printer*** is the name of the printer selected. The [ ***Printer***]** **

**Properties** dialog box allows you to specify page setup and other settings specific to the selected printer.

o The **Status** field displays the state of the selected printer, such as, busy or idle. This field is read-only.

o The **Type** field displays the type of printer currently selected. This field is read-only.

o The **Where** field identifies the printer path, printer port, queue name, or physical location of the currently selected printer. This field is read-only.

o The **Comment** section displays the comments entered during printer configuration. This field is read-only.

name and location for the print file. Then, you can print the saved

drawing file from a computer that does not have the application

installed or print to a printer other than the one currently configured.

- **Print range**:

o The **Drawing** option allows you to print the entire drawing.

o The **View** option activates the **All** and **Active** check boxes. You can use these checkboxes to define the view or views to print. The **All**

option prints each defined view associated with the drawing. The

**Active** option prints only the active view.

o The **Selection** option prints the user-defined area. When you select this option, the **Settings** button at the bottom of the **Print** dialog box is disabled.

- **Options**:

o The **Fit to page** checkbox allows you to print the entire drawing on one page.

o The **Print watermark** checkbox allows you to print a watermark, a faint graphic, in the drawing background.

o The **Print black and white** checkbox prints the drawing in black and white.

- **Copies**:

o The **Number of copies** pull-down list allows you to select the number of copies you want to print. You can either type a number or select

from the list.

o The **Collate** checkbox allows you to print the copies in proper binding order.

The **Settings** button opens the **Settings** dialog box, which allows you to view and edit the scale and origin of the print area. This button is disabled when the **Selection** option in the **Print range** section is selected.

**Settings Dialog Box**

The **Settings** dialog box in Smart P&ID has three sections: **Scale**, **Origin**, and **Preview**.

284 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Printing Drawings*

---

- **Scale**:

o The **Best fit** option scales the selected drawing sheets or print area to fit the printer paper for the configured device.

o The **Manual scale** option specifies the scale value to apply to the print range during printing. For example, if the print range is a rectangle of 12 cm by 12 cm and you set a manual scale of 1:12, the printed range

appears to be 1 cm by 1 cm on the printer paper. If you want a 1:1

drawing of the current sheet scale, you can set the **Paper** **length** option to 1 and the **Design length** option to 1.

▪ The **Paper length** field allows you to specify the paper length for the document you want to print with respect to the **Design length**

option.

▪ The **Design length** field allows you to specify a design length (size of the printed graphic) with respect to the **Paper length** option.

- **Origin**:

o The **Center** checkbox allows you to position the print area center to the center of the printer paper. If you do not set this option, the print area center is positioned to the bottom left of the printer paper.

o The **X origin** field allows you to set a shift in the x-direction from the origin.

o The **X origin** field allows you to set a shift in the y-direction from the origin.

- **Preview** – This section provides a preview of how the graphic will print on the sheet. The display is updated dynamically based on changes made to

the other options in the dialog box.

**Note:**

- ** **Zero length pipe runs will print if you print the drawing using Smart P&ID. For example, when a reducer is connected to a nozzle, the zero-length pipe run between these symbols will print. Zero length pipe runs will not print if you print the drawing using** Drawing Manager**.

**Printing Multiple Drawings**

**Drawing Manager** allows you to print more than one drawing at a time rather than printing drawings one-by-one from Smart P&ID. You can add drawings to the print queue from any number of units or areas in a plant structure and then specify printing options, such as watermark, whether to print

inconsistencies, and drawing orientation, for all selected drawings. **Drawing** **Manager** also allows you to schedule batch printing for a later time or at regular intervals by using the **Schedule** option in the **Print** dialog box.

**Print Command in Drawing Manager**

You can select one or more drawings and then use the **Print** command on the **File** menu in **Drawing Manager** to send the selected drawing(s) to a specified printer, plotter, or file. The **Print** command opens the **Print** dialog box. This **Print** dialog box is different from the **Print** dialog box in Smart P&ID.

While you can print just one drawing at a time from **Drawing Manager**, the **Print** command in **Drawing Manager** does not have all the single-print capabilities of the **Print** command in Smart P&ID. For instance, **Drawing** **Manager** only prints the entire drawing; whereas, in Smart P&ID, you can also print just a selection or a view inside the drawing.

290 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Importing Drawing Data*

**Importing Drawing Data**

There are several ways you can import data into Smart P&ID. You can import data and items into the database using reports and other files.

**SmartSketch®** files can be imported into Smart P&ID using the **SmartPlant** **Migrator** wizard, which opens when you select the **SmartSketch** command on the **File > Import** menu. To import a **SmartSketch** drawing into Smart P&ID, you must have **SmartSketch** installed on your computer.

The **File > Import** > **Data File** command allows you to import data and items into the database from some Smart P&ID reports. Other data files can be imported by customizing the import code. Relationships between items cannot be imported; only items and their properties can be imported.

You can populate or redefine pipe run properties by importing an **Aspen Basic** **Engineering ( *Zyqad*)** stream data file. During the import process, you can assign the stream and its associated engineering data to the pipe run.

**Note:**

- The log file for the import activities is called *SPImport.log*; it is saved to the local *Temp* directory. If errors are encountered during the import process, the **Import Log** dialog box is displayed. If no errors are encountered, the **Import** **Log** dialog box is not displayed but the log may be found in the *~\temp* folder.

**Importing an Aspen Basic Engineering ( *Zyqad*) Stream Data** **File**

1. Select a pipe run in the drawing.
2. Select the **Stream No.**  field in the **Properties** window and click the **Calculation** button to display the **Stream Number** dialog box.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 291

*Importing Drawing Data*

1. Click the **Browse** button to search for a file on your computer or the network.

This displays the **Stream Data File Location** dialog box.

1. Specify the folder and select the **Aspen Basic Engineering ( *Zyqad*)** data file ( *streamdata.txt*, *.xls*, or *.xml*).
2. Click the **Open** button. This closes the **Stream Data File Location** dialog box and updates the file name in the **Stream Number** dialog box.
3. Select an appropriate **Stream ID** from the **Stream ID** pull-down list, which lists the values found in the text file specified in the **File name** box.

292 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Importing Drawing Data*

1. Click the **OK** button in the **Stream Number** dialog box. The values for the **Stream No** property and other relevant properties are updated in the **Properties** window.

**Notes:**

- If a format change is made to an exported **Aspen Basic Engineering** **( *Zyqad*)** report, you must make modifications to the import code to accommodate the changed report layout.
- View the *Smart P&ID Programming Help*  for more information on import code and other importing parameters.
- Smart P&ID supports **Aspen Basic Engineering ( *Zyqad*)** spreadsheets in either Microsoft® Excel or XML format. These spreadsheets include the

**Vessel Equipment List**, **Pump Equipment List**, and **Heat Exchanger** **Equipment**.

- Importing **Aspen Basic Engineering ( *Zyqad*)** XML data files allow greater flexibility when importing data into the software. All three reports, **Vessel Equipment List**, **Pump Equipment List**, and **Heat Exchanger** **Equipment,**  are included in a single XML report so that only one file must be imported.
- Stockpile items added due to the process of importing **Aspen Basic** **Engineering ( *Zyqad*)** data can be easily updated by re-importing a data file. Items imported earlier are updated with the data from the newly

imported file irrespective of the location of the items, whether in the stockpile or in the drawing.

**Using Reports to Import Items into the Stockpile and to**

**Update Existing Items**

You can use the **Equipment List** and the **Pipe Run List** reports to import items into the stockpile. This allows you to define values for an item that does not yet exist in the database. Both reports have hidden columns that store some key information necessary for importing values.

You can also use a report to import information for items that already exist in the database and are currently placed in the drawing. Items must have an item tag assigned prior to definition or modification of properties. You must first run the report, add or edit property values for the items returned in the report, and then import the items back into the drawing. This will update the property values for the items.

You can use the **Equipment List**, **Equipment Nozzle List**, and **Pipe Run List** reports to do this. These reports can also create occurrences of items in the stockpile.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 303

*Drawing Revisions and Versions*

***Compare Dialog Box***

The **Compare** Dialog Box displays two versions of the same drawing and indicates the differences between them. The differences between drawing versions are assigned to logical “change” groups. Differences also belong to either **Data** or **Graphic**:

- **Data** - Refers to a mismatch in the properties assigned to an item that exists in both drawings, namely a change, addition, or deletion of a property in the **Properties** window or in the **Engineering Data Editor** in Smart P&ID, or through automation.
- **Graphic** - Refers to an item that has changed only in its graphical representation in the design (for example, the item is moved or otherwise graphically

manipulated in the drawing).

**Notes:**

- The following differences are ignored: claim status, select list strings, linked or embedded objects, symbology, and inconsistency indicators.
- You can only compare a drawing against a version of itself; you cannot compare one drawing to another drawing.
- If you attempt to compare two versions that are identical to each other, the **Compare** dialog box does not open and a confirmation message alerts you as to why.
- You cannot do anything else in Drawing Manager while the **Compare** dialog box is open.

The two versions are displayed in two **Drawing** views, described only as left and right. The relationship between the two views depends on whether you are comparing two versions in your own database or comparing your version to a version in another database.

- If the two versions are in the active database, then the left-hand view is the older version, and the right-hand view is the newer version. That is, they are displayed in time-order from left to right.
- If the two versions exist in different databases, you cannot be assured that time-order is the logical order to display the versions; therefore, the right-hand view is reserved for the version in your active Plant or project database, and the left-hand view belongs to the version in another database.

**Note:**

- The **Compare** dialog box in Drawing Manager is useful reviewing differences between versions only. If you want to reconcile anything about the two

versions you review, then you must do so inside Smart P&ID with the **Compare and Refresh** command which exists for this purpose. If you started with the left-hand drawing version and applied every change listed on the 304 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

*Drawing Revisions and Versions*

**Compare** dialog box, then you would end with a drawing that is identical to the right drawing version.

**Toolbar Commands** - Apply to the **Drawing** views. If there is a drop-down arrow, you can apply the command to either the right or left view.

- **Compare Options**

Opens the **Compare Options** dialog box which allows

you to customize the colors that the various comparison states are displayed in.

That color-coding is then displayed in the status bar of the **Compare** dialog box as a static reminder.

- **Print** -

Prints the **Drawing** view or views.

- **Generate Report** -

Opens Microsoft Excel and creates a report of the

information contained in this comparing versions session. This report lists the same information that is displayed in the **Change Groups** and **Change Details** lists (change groups, item types, claim statuses, and so forth).

- **Find in List** -

Zooms to the **Change details** list entry that corresponds to an

item you select in either **Drawing** view. If you select a drawing item that exists in the list, then the list display automatically zooms to that entry.

- **Find in Drawings** -

Manipulates the **Drawing** views so that the selected

element is listed in the **Change details** and the **Change groups** list is centered in the appropriate **Drawing** view.

- **Zoom Area** -

Enlarges the display of an area in one or both **Drawing** views

by allowing you to draw a fence around that arbitrary area of the view.

*Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide* 305

*Drawing Revisions and Versions*

- **Zoom In** -

**Drawing Views** - The left and right drawing views display the two versions of your drawing being compared. The display above the drawing view shows the drawing name and the version. The select list in the display allows you to choose the drawing layers to be compared and can be selected individually for each version. Possible select list values are **Primary**, **Typical**, or **Both**.

If you compare two versions from different projects, the version that belongs to the other project appears in the left **Drawing** view and the version that belongs to your active Drawing Manager project appears in the right **Drawing** view. If you compare two versions from your active project, then the latest version appears in the right **Drawing** view.

At the top of each **Drawing** view, the Plant or project, the name of the drawing, and the version is displayed explicitly. You can move the bars between the different views per your needs. If you double-click on the divider between the left and right **Drawing** views, then the software automatically adjusts the two views to be the same-size.

**Properties Window** - Displays two columns of properties for an item selected in a **Drawing** view or in the **Change details** list. The left-hand and right-hand columns correspond to the left and right **Drawing** views. If a deleted item is selected (the item exists in left view, but not the right view), the properties for that item are listed in the left-hand column and the right-hand column is empty. If a modified item is selected, values from both versions show in their respective columns in the **Properties** window. If a new item is selected, that is, the item exists in right view, but not the left view, the properties for that item are listed in the right-hand column and the left-hand column is empty.

**Properties** **Commands** - Allows you to customize the properties that are displayed in the **Properties** window.

- **Alphabetical** -

Lists properties in alphabetical order. This button acts as a

toggle and is available when properties are displayed categorically.

306 * Smart P&ID Creating a P&ID Course Guide *

are defined and properties are assigned to those categories in Data Dictionary Manager. This button acts as a toggle and is available when properties are displayed alphabetically.

- **Show Modified** -

Toggles the display of only those properties that are

different between the properties that belong to a selected drawing item. This button applies only to modified items that exist in both versions; for added and deleted items, all properties are listed.

**Change groups** - Lists the changed items in groups. A listed item contains all the items this change effects. You can sort the list by clicking the column headings.

- **Check box** column - Displays colors in the drawings as defined using **Compare** **Options**. If not selected, the **Default items** color displays.
- **Number** - Displays an arbitrary number that is assigned to a logical change group when this dialog box is opened. The number has no intrinsic meaning and may apply to a different group the next time you open this dialog box.
- **Identifier** - Lists item tags for the principal member of the change group, if an item tag is assigned to that object. For instance, if a change group centers on data differences for a vessel and its nozzles, then the item tag for the vessel is displayed in this column.
- **Category** - Displays the highest priority of categories that appear in the **Change** **details** list for this group. The possible categories are data and graphic, listed in highest to lowest priority.
- **Claimed** - Displays an overview of the claim status of the individual items in the group. Possible values are **All**, **Some**, or **None**.
- **Valid Claim** - Indicates that the claimed item is a valid claim.

**Change details** - Lists all the individual items that belong to the group that you select from the **Change groups** list. You can sort this list by clicking on any one of the following column headings.

- **Result** - Displays one of three possible values: Left-Only, Right-Only, and Different. Left-Only denotes an item that exists in the left-hand version only, implying that the item is deleted from the right-hand version. Right-Only denotes an item that exists in the right-hand version only, implying that the item was added to the right-hand version. Different denotes a difference between the properties, graphics, or connectivity of an item that exists in both versions.
- **Item Type** - Describes the item type, such as **Instrument**, **PipeRun**, or **Nozzle**.
- **Specific Item Type** - Displays the specific type of item, such as **3-Way Ball** **Valve**, **Piping**, or **Flange Orifice**.
