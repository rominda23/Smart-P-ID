**Welcome to Intergraph Smart® P&ID Engineering**

Intergraph Smart® P&ID Engineering creates intelligent P&IDs by populating the database with relevant plant data. This method provides valuable information throughout the plant life cycle. As a data-centric, rulebased solution for the P&ID life cycle, Smart P&ID Engineering helps users improve design quality, data consistency, and standards compliance. With quick access to supporting engineering data, Smart P&ID

Engineering significantly cuts design and modification time and increases accuracy with its exclusive data-centric approach and use of design rules and automatic checks.

Smart P&ID Engineering is vastly different from graphic-driven P&ID solutions of today. All data from the P&ID is stored in the plant database and adheres to plant standards. The graphical representation of the P&ID is a view or a report of the data. The strong data import and export facilities of Smart P&ID

Engineering allow users to populate the system with relevant plant data, such as process data from process simulation databases based on Aspen Basic Engineering from Aspen Technologies, Inc. or equipment and line lists. The Import can be used to either update data on existing items in the plant database or to create new items in the Smart P&ID Engineering Stockpile to use for designing the P&ID.

The rule-based and automation capabilities of Smart P&ID Engineering also differentiate it from other P&ID

systems. Smart P&ID Engineering features a comprehensive, user-definable rule-based system that assists the engineer during the design phase of the plant and subsequent life cycle phases. Data is entered directly into the database; rules are executed; and feedback is immediate. The design rule-base confirms data consistency and compliance with plant and engineering standards, allowing faster, more efficient design with less iteration.

Smart P&ID Engineering incorporates the latest Microsoft technologies, such as OLE automation, to provide integration with existing data and other systems. Running on various Microsoft Windows operating system platforms, Smart P&ID Engineering does not require a traditional, expensive CAD engine for P&ID creation.

The open architecture of Smart P&ID Engineering permits integration with other systems, such as Smart 3D, Smart Instrumentation, and Aspen Basic Engineering, all of which allow users to share data with third-party software.

In Smart P&ID Engineering, users cannot alter drawing graphics. The only changes users are allowed to make are related to properties of items in the drawing or stockpiles. In addition, the following restrictions apply:

It is not possible to add or delete items (such as plant items, labels, OPCs, annotations, notes, and so forth) on the drawing sheet.

It is not possible to place items from the plant or drawing stockpiles into the drawing.

It is not possible to move items on the drawing sheet even if doing so does not impact the connectivity of items (including labels and annotations).

The following menu commands are disabled:

**Smart P&ID Engineering Program Group**

Smart P&ID Engineering provides multiple views of a central, unified data structure that represents the plant model. A view is a visual presentation of the data in the plant model and can be a schematic drawing or a table. The plant model is the computer representation of the conceptual design, including all plant components and their relationships. By manipulating model views, you can organize the information within the plant model to better understand and maintain the data.

Smart P&ID Engineering has several programs and utilities for running and managing your plant data.

**Smart P&ID Engineering** allows you to view Smart

P&ID Engineering drawings and to edit data in those

drawings.

**Drawing Manager** allows you to create and delete

drawings, manage drawing versions, and print

multiple drawings.

**Insulation Specification Manager** allows you to

create and modify lookup tables for insulation

specifications and thicknesses.

**Options Manager** defines plant-wide graphic

standards for symbology, gapping, heat tracing, and

formats. Options Manager also defines paths to

Smart P&ID Engineering files and directories.

**Rule Manager** defines rules for placement and

property copying on placement.

**Navigating in the Software**

The drawing interface is divided into four distinct parts: the **Design** window, the **Catalog Explorer**, the **Engineering Data Editor**, and the **Properties** window. Each part provides specific features required to create drawings in the software.

**Design Window**

The **Design** window displays Drawing views and the **Engineering Data Editor**. Each of these views provide a way to enter information for the plant model into the database. The two views also provide different ways to view information in the database. In the Drawing view, you can see the traditional diagram of a plant containing equipment, instrumentation, and piping in a graphical representation. The **Engineering** **Data Editor** allows you to see the same information in a tabular format, and it can also display items in the plant and drawing stockpiles. See Working with the Design Window.

**Engineering Data Editor**

The **Engineering Data Editor** is a modification of the stockpile display. This view is exactly the same tabular view that displays in the **Design** window, with the same capabilities for modifying the display, editing

properties, and organizing data. See Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor.

**Catalog Explorer**

**Catalog Explorer** displays all available catalog items (symbols and assemblies). Using **Catalog Explorer**, you can quickly navigate to the required catalog items, organize them as Favorites, add them to the Quick Catalog, or flag them for easy access. See Using Catalog Explorer.

**Properties Window**

When you select an item in a plant model, you can enter, view and modify the properties associated with that item in the **Properties** window. The System Administrator defines customized properties and their defaults for each item in Data Dictionary Manager. See Working with the Properties Window.

**Working with the Design Window**

The **Design** view, or Modeler, consists of several parts and displays the model information for a design in a **Drawing** or **Engineering Data Editor** view. You can open as many windows as needed to support a design. Each window has its own independent set of properties defining view range, display properties, and so forth.

You can define one or more **Engineering Data Editors** for a drawing. The **Engineering Data Editor** displays drawing information in a table, much like a **Properties** pane. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, you can specify filters and layouts to define the table information and edit some item properties.

Using the commands on the **Window** menu, you can cascade or tile views to more easily navigate among them.

(5) **Properties** **Pane**

A list of properties shown for a selected item or a select set of multiple items. You can attach the **Properties** pane to any edge of the main window.

(6) **Drawing** **View**

A graphical representation of the plant model. This view displays the common idea of a model: a diagram containing items such as equipment, piping, and instrumentation.

(7) **Engineering Data Editor**

A tabular view that presents the plant data in a tabular format. See Navigating in the Engineering Data

Editor.

Smart P&ID Engineering provides multiple views of a central, unified data structure that represents the plant model. A view is a visual presentation of the data that composes the plant model and can be a schematic drawing or a table. The plant model is the computer representation of the conceptual design in its entirety, including all plant components and their relationships. By manipulating model views, you can organize the information within the plant model to better understand and maintain the data.

The software continually updates the database as you edit a drawing; however, the software does not update the drawing file until you save the file (when you select **File** > **Save** or when you quit the program and save). Occasionally, the software can end in an abnormal way (for example, due to power outage). As a result, the database is updated with changes that you posted to the drawing, but the drawing file reflects the status when you last saved the drawing. When you re-open the drawing, the software recognizes that the drawing file is different from the database and displays a message: **One or more items** **in this drawing are inconsistent with the database**. Select **OK** to re-create the drawing from the database.

**Show Command**

Available on the **Drawing View** shortcut menu, the **Show** command allows you to choose to display drawing elements such as notes, labels and grids.

**Options Command (Tools Menu)**

Changes settings that control recently used files, screen appearance, placement information, export formats, and so forth. Opens the **Options** dialog.

**Options Dialog**

Sets options for the current drawing. For example, you can set the number of recently used files that appear on the **File** menu. Open this dialog by selecting **Tools** > **Options** on the main menu bar. The **Options** dialog has four tabs:

**Use Defaults**

Sets all the colors listed above to the default display value.

**Placement Tab (Options Dialog)**

Sets the default construction status for the active drawing, and tolerances for locating items in the drawing.

**Default construction status**

Assigns the selected construction status to all placed items. This list contains the following options: **New**, **Existing**, and **Future**. The plant administrator sets the plant-wide default at setup, but this option allows you to change the default on a drawing-by-drawing basis. The construction status for an item appears in the **Properties** window when the item is selected. Also, the construction status can be set for individual drawing items by changing its value in the **Properties** window.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, the settings for this option only apply to new items sent to the stockpile.

**Locate**

Specifies the range, called the locate zone, at which a candidate item is highlighted when another item approaches. If you are selecting drawing items, the locate tolerance defines how close the pointer must approach to select the item.

**Break-away**

Sets the number of pixels at which an item disconnects from its parent item.

**Place Partner OPC in Stockpile**

Indicates that when a new off-page connector (OPC) is placed, the partner OPC is automatically stored in the Stockpile. If you clear this option, the **Set Stockpile Location of Partner OPC** dialog appears after you place a new OPC.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, placement is not allowed. Therefore, the settings for the **Break-away** and** Place Partner OPC in Stockpile** options does not affect the software behavior.

**Files Tab (Options Dialog)**

to specify the location for storing report templates.

**Scale reference files**

A new Drawing view is not the same as a new drawing. You create new drawings in Smart P&ID

Engineering Drawing Manager. See Smart P&ID Engineering Drawing Manager Help.

You can have as many **Drawing** views open for a drawing as needed.

Drawing views are named according to the name of the drawing file. For example, the first drawing view created for the **Pipeline.pid** file is named **Pipeline.pid:1**. Each subsequent drawing view is assigned the next consecutive number.

If the software gives indications that a drawing is in use when it is not, quit all Smart P&ID Engineering applications, and then open the Windows Task Manager. In Task Manager, search for an extra draft.exe process. Select it and select **End Task**. See Microsoft Windows Help.

**Active Window List**

Displays an alphabetical list of open document windows below the commands on the **Window** menu. You can access another open document by selecting one of the window names on the list.

**Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor**

The **Engineering Data Editor** (**EDE**) uses a grid or tabular format to display the query results for the database. The **Engineering Data Editor** is automatically displayed in the lower left of the main window, and you can also open the **Engineering Data Editor** in the **Design** window.

The standard **Engineering Data Editor** is displayed when you open a drawing and by default displays the data for items in the active drawing and Active Drawing Stockpile when you select an item type or a saved view. For convenient review and editing of plant data, you can open a standalone EDE which displays the data in all drawings in the plant and in the Stockpile. The standalone EDE is available when no drawing is open in Smart P&ID Engineering.

**The Engineering Data Editor Toolbar**

At the top of the **Engineering Data Editor** is the toolbar, which contains the following menu buttons: **Actions**

Includes commands that allow you to delete stockpile items or move items between stockpiles.

**Edit**

Includes commands that allow you to copy and paste data and to claim items or release claimed items.

**View**

Includes commands that allow you to edit, save, or delete **Engineering Data Editor** views, to filter or refresh the display, to generate reports, and to specify display settings for the views.

Select the down-arrow next to the menu button to expose the available commands.

The list on the toolbar contains filters that query the database and display the corresponding items in the **Engineering Data Editor**. If you want to list all items, select **Plant Item** from the list.

You can also filter the display by using the buttons that correspond to different stockpiles and drawings (by default, initially only the **Active Drawing** and **Active Drawing Stockpile** buttons are selected): **Active Drawing**

Displays properties of the items that belong to the drawing you are currently viewing. This includes properties of implied items, which do not appear on the drawing sheet. This option is disabled in a standalone EDE.

**Active Drawing Stockpile**

Displays items existing in the data model that have not been placed in the graphic drawing. This option is disabled in a standalone EDE.

**Stockpile**

Displays items for the plant existing in the data model that have not been placed in the graphic drawing.

**Other Drawings**

Displays properties of the items that appear in all drawings in the plant other than the active drawing, including items in the stockpiles of other drawings.

The list box displays available item types for selection as well as any saved views.

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Displays the **Filter** tab of the **Asking Filter** dialog, from which you can quickly filter the **Engineering Data** **Editor** display by selecting a base filter and properties appropriate for the selected item type. You can re-query and thereby refresh the **Engineering Data Editor** display by selecting the **Refresh** button . Finally, a summary box displays a comparison between the number of items in the view and the total number of items, of the type chosen in the list, that exist in the database.

When pagination is invoked, filter applies to the entire data set.

**Refresh**

Refreshes the **Engineering Data Editor**.

**Save to Excel**

Saves the current EDE view to an Excel sheet.

**Cancel Grouping** /** Enable Grouping**

Toggles the display of the Grouping area above the EDE. Selecting **Cancel Grouping** hides the Grouping area and cancels any current grouping of the data. After canceling, the Grouping area remains hidden even if you select a different item type to display in the EDE.

**Standalone EDE Command (File > Open Menu)**

This command is only available when Smart P&ID Engineering is opened without selecting any drawing. It opens a standalone version of the **Engineering Data Editor** and on selecting an item type, all items of that type in the plant and in the plant stockpile are displayed in the EDE grid. In a standalone EDE, you can run all the commands for querying and editing the data as you can in a standard EDE.

**Open a standalone EDE**

1. Open Smart P&ID Engineering.
2. Go to **File** > **Open** > **Standalone EDE**.
3. Select the item type whose data you want to display.

In the standalone EDE, the **Stockpile** and **Other Drawings** buttons are enabled, while the **Active Drawing** and **Active Drawing Stockpile** buttons are disabled.

If you select a row in the EDE and run the **Highlight in Drawing** command, the drawing containing the item opens and the standalone EDE becomes a standard EDE with the **Active Drawing** and **Active Drawing Stockpile** buttons enabled.

If you subsequently open a drawing from the **Open** > **Smart P&ID Drawing** command or from Drawing Manager, the standalone EDE with any displayed data closes and an instance of the https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 32/573

standard EDE is displayed.

**Customizing the Engineering Data Editor**

You can change the content and layout of the **Engineering Data Editor** rather extensively.

By specifying the display settings, you can define the font that Stockpile items appear in, for instance. You can also use display settings to clarify the cells that are read-only and the cells that allow you to enter new property information or modify existing information. You can filter one or more columns and limit the number of items displayed. Create your own filters to narrowly define the contents of the view and create unique layouts with specific properties in the order you want.

After you have defined and edited a view, you can save it and also delete it later, if necessary.

**Customize the Data in the Current Engineering Data Editor View**

The software allows you to perform various actions in an open view. You can customize the grid view in the following ways:

**Search the Grid**

In the **Search** field, as you type, items that match the search criteria are highlighted in yellow in the grid. To clear your search, click the X on the right.

If none of the cells in a row contain the search string, that row is hidden from the view.

If none of the cells in the entire grid contain the search string, all the data rows are hidden and the **Search** field is displayed with a red border.

When pagination is invoked, you can apply the search to all pages or to the current page only. The search options work as follows with pagination:

**Current Page** — Displays only the rows from the current page that have matching strings. If there are no matching strings on a particular page, all the rows on that page are displayed.

**All Pages** — Displays the rows from all the pages that have matching strings. The rows are displayed in one or more pages corresponding to the total number of rows with matching strings and the number of rows per page that was set.

**Group Columns in the Grid**

To group your data by a specific attribute, drag the column header to the **Grouping** area where the following text appears: “Drag a column header and drop it here to group by that column.” You can group more than one attribute, by dragging another column header to this **Grouping** area. The order in which you apply the grouping changes the order of the displayed results.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 33/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

When pagination is invoked, grouping is applied to the current page only.

In the **Engineering Data Editor**, if the Grouping area is not visible, select the **Enable Grouping** button on the EDE toolbar.

**Freeze Columns**

To freeze columns, hold the cursor between the leftmost column and the adjacent column until it changes to a double-headed arrow, and then drag the vertical bar to the end of the last column you want to freeze. To unfreeze columns, position the cursor on the bar and when it changes to a double-headed arrow, drag the bar back to the extreme left.

**Apply text wrapping to a column**

Text wrapping is not applied to the column data, by default. It is applied to individual columns using a shortcut menu. To apply text wrapping to a column, right-click the column header and select **Wrap Text**.

**Sort Items in the Grid**

The first time you open a view, the results are displayed in an ascending order based on the **Item Tag** column. Select a column header to sort by the values in that header in ascending order. To change the sorting order to descending, select the column header again. A small arrow in the column header displays the sort order. Selecting the column header a third time removes the sorting (rows are sorted in ascending order by the **Item Tag** column values). Press and hold the SHIFT key and select columns to sort by more than one column. When sorting by multiple columns, the column headers display a small number beside the arrow to indicate the column sequence for sorting:

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 34/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

When sorting column values in ascending order, the sorting behavior depends on the type of data as follows:

For columns with units of measure, the values are sorted in order of SI value regardless of the units, for example: 3.5 mm, 3.0 cm, 2.000 in, 4.0 in. Where several identical SI values exist, sorting is as follows:

Identical values with the same units of measure, but with a different number of decimal places are sorted in ascending order according to the number of decimal places, for example: 2.0 in, 2.000 in.

Identical values with different formats based on the same type of units of measure are sorted in ascending alphabetical order of the units (with symbols preceding letters of the alphabet), for example: 3.0”, 3.0 in or 5.0 mil, 5.0 mm.

Values for all other data types are sorted alphabetically.

Cells with NULL values are not sorted and always appear at the top of the grid.

Empty cells are sorted and appear at the top when sorting in ascending order and at the bottom when sorting in descending order.

When pagination is invoked, sorting applies to the entire data set.

**Filter Items in the Grid**

1. To filter your data, select **Filter**  in the column header.
2. Set the filter parameters in the **Filter by Column Data** dialog: Use **Search** to find specific strings.

Select the required strings from the distinct strings list. Or, you can select all the distinct strings in the list using the **Select All** checkbox. See **Select All** in the** **Filter by Column Data Dialog.

In the **Show rows with value that** section, select the required operator from the list, then type a value in the blank field, and if required, select **And/Or.**

1. Select **Filter**.

To remove the filter criteria for a column:

1. Select **Filter**  in the column header.
2. In the Filter by Column Data Dialog, select **Clear Filter.**

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

If an identical string appears in more than one row in the grid, that string is shown only once in the list.

If a column includes empty values, a checkbox with the value **[empty]** appears in the list.

When filtering numerical data with units of measure, the filtered results are sorted in order of SI value regardless of the units.

A filtered column is indicated by a solid **Filter** icon .

If the filter is already applied and a filtered value is changed to a new value outside the range defined by the filter, the row with the new value is immediately excluded from the grid display.

When pagination is invoked, filter applies to the entire data set.

**Filtering the Engineering Data Editor**

You can filter the items displayed in the **Engineering Data Editor** by using the column filter. For example, if the **Engineering Data Editor** displays **Equipment: Vessels** but you want to see only towers, select the Filter icon at the top of the **Eq Subclass** column and choose **Towers**.

To create more elaborate filters and displays, use the **Edit View** command and enter options in the **Edit** **View** and **Advanced View Properties** dialogs. See Define a Filter for an Engineering Data Editor View.

**Apply Filters in the Engineering Data Editor**

1. Select **Filter** from the column header for the column you want to filter.
2. Set the filter parameters in the **Filter by Column Data** dialog: Use **Search** to find specific strings.

Select the required strings from the distinct strings list. Or, you can select all the distinct strings in the list using the **Select All** checkbox. See **Select All** in the** **Filter by Column Data Dialog.

In the **Show rows with value that** section, select the required operator from the list, then type a value in the blank field, and if required, select **And/Or.**

1. Select **Filter**.

To remove the filter criteria for a column:

A filtered column is indicated by a solid **Filter** icon .

If the filter is already applied and a filtered value is changed to a new value outside the range defined by the filter, the row with the new value is immediately excluded from the grid display.

When pagination is invoked, filter applies to the entire data set.

**Filter by Column Data Dialog**

Opens when you select the Filter icon at the top of a column in the **Engineering Data Editor**. Allows you to specify filter criteria for the selected column to determine the display of items in the **EDE**.

When specifying three or more criteria, it is recommended that you avoid using complex combinations of **And** or **Or** operators to prevent unwanted results of the filtering.

**Clear Filter**

Clears all previously-defined filter settings and closes the dialog.

**Search**

Performs a search-as-you-type filter on column values for which any part of the column value matches the search string.

**Select All**

Use to select all the distinct strings displayed in the list. The filter can be applied on a maximum of 5000

distinct strings. If the strings you selected exceed 5000, the software displays a message stating that you have exceeded the selection limit, and the **Filter** button is unavailable.

**(Unique value check boxes)**

Displays the distinct strings for all the values that appear in the column. If the column contains blank cells, these are indicated by the value **[empty]**. Select checkboxes beside the values to be included; clear the checkboxes beside the values to be excluded.

**Show rows with value that**

Allows you to specify additional filter criteria based on strings that comprise all or part of the data values.

The criteria specified under **Show rows with value that** are *additive* with respect to the filtered values specified by the check boxes, that is, when both sections are used to define a filter, they make the filter more restrictive. These criteria might not work as expected for certain values of the Nominal Diameter property.

The available comparison operator options for columns whose data type is *string* or *select list* are as follows:

**Is Equal To**

**Is Not Equal To**

**Is Less Than**

**Is Less Than Or Equal to**

**Is Greater Than**

**Is Greater Than Or Equal to**

For data of *string* type only, the following additional comparison operator options are available: **Starts With**

**Ends With**

**Contains**

**Does Not Contain**

When specifying several criteria, you can choose **And** or **Or** to specify the relationship between the criteria as follows:

**And -** Means that both the current and succeeding criteria must be met.

**Or -** Means that either the current or succeeding criteria must be met.

**Add**

Adds a row for a new criterion below the current criterion (not available for the first criterion row).

Delete

Deletes the entire row containing the criterion (not available for the first two criteria rows). Select the ‘x’

beside the string used to specify the value of the criterion to clear that value.

**Filter**

Displays the filtered results in the EDE.

**Pagination**

When displaying data rows in the **Engineering Data Editor**, there is a setting that limits the number of data rows that can be displayed in the EDE view. If the number of rows exceeds this number, the software https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 38/573

creates additional pages for the display of the data rows. By default, the number of rows per page is set to 500; however, you can change this number to any value between 5 and 3000.

Below the EDE grid, **Displaying Rows** shows:

The total number of rows available in the database for an EDE query.

The number of rows matching the column filter or the search criteria.

When you apply a column filter or a search, the number of rows matching the filter or search criteria and the total number of rows in the database for the selected item type are displayed.

When you apply pagination in the EDE view, the number of rows displayed on the current page and the total number of rows in the database are displayed.

In the above example:

1 to 5 is the range of rows displayed in the current page.

20 is the resultant rows for the search or column filter criteria.

50 is the total number of rows in the database for the EDE query.

Reducing the number of rows displayed per page improves performance when displaying, filtering, sorting, or searching data rows.

**Set the number of rows to display per page**

Below the EDE grid, in the **Rows per page** box, type a number between 5 and 3000 and press **Enter** or **Tab** to set the value.

When you open a session of the Smart P&ID Modeler, the number of rows per page is set to 500 by default.

When you change the value in the **Rows per page** box and make other changes in the EDE, selecting the **Refresh** button also sets the new value.

**Search for data on multiple pages**

When pagination is applied to the EDE, you can apply the search to all pages or to the current page only.

The search options work as follows with pagination:

**Current Page**

Displays only the rows from the current page that have matching strings. If there are no matching strings on a particular page, all the rows on that page are displayed.

**All Pages**

Displays the rows from all the pages that have matching strings. The rows are displayed in one or more pages corresponding to the total number of rows with matching strings and the number of rows per page that was set.

**Navigate between pages**

Use the navigation controls to move back and forth between pages or to go to the first or last page. To go to a particular page, type the number of that page in the box and press the **Tab** key.

**Editing Item Properties in the Engineering Data Editor**

Item properties in the **Engineering Data Editor** can be edited much the same way as they are in the **Properties** window; however, there are some differences:

The software displays a different background color for read-only and read/write properties in the **Engineering Data Editor**. These display options are configured on the **Display Settings** dialog. See

Customize the Display of the Engineering Data Editor.

The **Engineering Data Editor** can be configured to display properties that are not shown in the **Properties** window. See Define a Layout for an Engineering Data Editor View.

Properties of items in non-active drawings and non-active drawing stockpiles can be edited in the **Engineering Data Editor**. See Perform Plant Editing.

When editing a select list property in the **Properties** window, it is possible to select the property from the list or to type part or all of the value directly in the field. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, it is also possible to select the property from the list; when selecting a value by typing, it is possible to type the first letter of the property value or to type letters in succession quickly to choose a particular value. If several property values start with a particular letter, repeatedly typing that letter in an **Engineering** **Data Editor** cell allows you to move through those values.

Using the CTRL or SHIFT key in the **Engineering Data Editor**, it is possible to select multiple properties (cells) for an item (row), copy those properties, and paste them to other items.

A list arrow (select list) and an ellipsis (calculation button) are displayed for a property in the **Engineering Data Editor** much the same as in the **Properties** window except for the case when both https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 40/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

exist for the property. When both the list arrow and the ellipsis exist for a property (for example, the **Loop Tag** property of a pipe run) they are both displayed in the **Properties** window but only the list arrow is displayed in the **Engineering Data Editor**.

In the **Properties** window, you can highlight a value that belongs to a select list and simply clear its contents by pressing the **Delete** key. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, you must first highlight the value inside the list before being able to delete it.

All Plant Item Group associations are editable in both the **Properties** window and in the **Engineering** **Data Editor**. One exception is the **Hydraulic Circuit Item Tag** property, which is editable in the **Properties** window but is read-only in the **Engineering Data Editor**.

If the selected item (row) in the **Engineering Data Editor** is in the active drawing, that item is highlighted in the drawing and its properties are displayed in the **Properties** window as if it had been selected in the drawing. If the selected item is in a non-active drawing, its properties are *not* displayed in the **Properties** window; however, on the shortcut menu, the **Highlight in Drawing** command can be used to open the drawing in which the item appears. Selecting this command zooms in on the item in the drawing that opens, highlights it, and displays its properties in the **Properties** window.

The **Plant Group Name** property is dependent on the **Plant Group Type** property and hence the **Plant Group Name** property cannot be assigned until the **Plant Group Type** property is assigned. If you remove the **Plant Group Type** property, then **Plant Group Name** property is also removed. Both the **Plant Group Type** and **Plant Group Name** properties have to be assigned for an item, therefore if the **Plant Group Type** property is assigned and the **Plant Group Name** property is not available or removed for an item, the software removes the **Plant Group Type** value as follows: **Active drawing and stockpile view**: Whether the change is made in the **Properties** window or in the **Engineering Data Editor**, the **Plant Group Type** value is not removed while in the same drawing session. Refreshing the **Engineering Data Editor** does not remove the **Plant Group** **Type** value. Only closing the drawing removes the **Plant Group Type** value.

**Other drawing**: If **Pagination** is enabled in **Engineering Data Editor**, then toggling the **Other** **Drawing** view removes the **Plant Group Type** value. If **Pagination** is not enabled, then refreshing the **Engineering Data Editor** removes the **Plant Group Type** value.

When copying and pasting data between cells in the **Engineering Data Editor** where one property is dependent upon another, the higher dependent (parent) property must be in a column to the left of the dependency (child) property in the layout. For example, if copying both **Fluid System** and **Fluid Code** property values from one row to one or more other rows in the **Engineering Data Editor**, **Fluid System** must be located to the left of **Fluid Code** in the layout. Likewise, if copying **Plant Group Type** and **Plant** **Group Name** properties, **Plant Group Type** must be located to the left of **Plant Group Name** in the layout.

**Edit the Engineering Data Editor View**

1. On the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar, select the arrow beside the **View** menu icon and from the menu list, select **Edit View**.
2. On the **Edit View** dialog, define the items that you want to see in the **Engineering Data Editor**. You can customize a filter and layout for the display on the **Advanced View Properties** dialog . See

Modify the Properties of an Existing Engineering Data Editor View.

The software identifies read-only properties in the **Engineering Data Editor** visually by using the display options that you set using the **Display Settings** command. See Customize the Display of the

Engineering Data Editor.

**Edit Active Drawing Item Properties in the Engineering Data Editor** Two possibilities are available for updating drawing item properties in the **Engineering Data Editor**: Direct editing of properties

Copying and pasting property values

To display the data for editing, choose an item type from the **Engineering Data Editor** select list or ensure that **Active Drawing** is selected to display properties of the items that appear in the drawing you are currently viewing.

You can also display or hide stockpile items by toggling the **Active Drawing Stockpile** and **Stockpile** commands.

If a cell is populated by a read-only property or a property that is only automatically generated by validation, you cannot edit or paste data into that cell.

**Edit the data in the grid**

1. Select any cell in the grid and enter your new content or change existing content as follows: For text, select the cell and just type the required value.

For a list of values (or equivalent quantitative values with different units of measure), double-click the cell and select the required value from the drop-down list that becomes available.

For a field with a calculation command (ellipsis), double-click the cell and then select the ellipsis to open a dialog.

1. When done, select outside the cell to exit Edit mode and save the contents.

When populating cells with numeric values, enter a number within the minimum and maximum values that an integer data type can handle; that is, between 0 and 2147483647.

If you change a property value of an active drawing item in the **Engineering Data Editor** and this causes other properties in the active drawing to be updated because System Editing or validation is activated, the software automatically updates the **Engineering Data Editor** display.

If a property value in the **Engineering Data Editor** is changed by the user or as a result of an automatic update and this property is used for sorting, the software does not update the sort order of the data automatically if the values are no longer in the correct order.

When editing the **Plant Group Name** property in the **Engineering Data Editor** or the **Properties** window, if identical plant group names exist, holding the mouse pointer over a selected value from the list displays a tool tip showing the plant group hierarchy path for that value. Therefore, if two units named U1 are available in the list, displaying the tool tip will show the different paths for the names; for example **\A1\U1** and **\A2\U1**.

When editing a date field, selecting in the field activates the date picker window. It is not possible to type values in a date field. To clear a value from a date field, select in the field and press the space, **Backspace**, or **Delete** key. The same behavior applies for the **Properties** window.

**Copy and paste data**

You must exit Edit mode to be able to copy and paste data.

1. Select the cell with the data you want to copy, right-click and select **Copy** on the shortcut menu.
2. Select a target cell (single-click) or multiple cells (using the CTRL or SHIFT key) where you want to paste the data, right-click and on the shortcut menu, select **Paste**.

If you selected a single row as the source, you can paste the content of that row into multiple target rows (excluding the cells related to the item tag).

A red border appears around a cell if the copied contents cannot be pasted into that cell because, for example, the cell is read-only or the data type of the target cell is incompatible with the data type of the copied contents.

The copied information will be cleared (and so will the copy – dash indication) from the clipboard and not pasted in the following cases:

When the selected cell is in Edit mode (activated by double-clicking the cell).

When one or more of the changes are made to the EDE layout, such as editing the EDE definition, column addition, column re-ordering, splitting the screen, applying a filter, or sorting.

See Copy and Paste EDE Data - Troubleshooting.

**Copy and Paste EDE Data - Troubleshooting**

If the copy/paste is not successful, one of the following messages is displayed in the ribbon bar: **Cannot paste the selected cells:**

Check you have selected destination cells.

Check that the selected cells are not in Edit mode.

Make sure that the selected destination layout matches the copied cells layout. The destination area needs to contain the same layout of rows and columns as the source.

**Cannot set lookup value from different source:**

You are trying to paste a value from a cell where the values are from a select list to a cell that cannot contain select list values. For example, a value copied from a select list of instrument manufacturers cannot be pasted to a cell with a select list of model numbers. You can only copy select list value to a cell with the same select list type or to a blank cell.

**Cannot set value to read-only cell:**

You are trying to paste a value into a cell whose properties have been set to read-only.

**Item cannot be pasted into list:**

You are trying to paste a value from a cell whose properties have a dependency on another property. For example, if a panel model in a particular cell is related to manufacturer Honeywell, it can only be pasted into another panel model cell for which the related manufacturer is also Honeywell.

**Plant Editing**

Plant Editing is the ability to use the **Engineering Data Editor** to manage data for all objects in the plant. If System Editing is enabled, data that is edited will propagate according to the System Editing rules defined for the plant.

**Plant Editing of Objects in Non-Active Drawings**

If a user edits an object in a non-active drawing, propagation of data takes place across Off-Page Connectors (OPCs) to other non-active drawings when all the drawings involved are not opened by a user.

**Plant Editing of Objects in an Active Drawing**

If a user edits an object in the active drawing, data will not propagate across OPCs beyond the active drawing boundary. Because the active drawing opened by the user is in a locked state, any data changes made in a non-active drawing will not propagate back across OPCs to the active drawing.

**Perform Plant Editing**

1. In Options Manager, select **Settings** and set the value for the **Enable Plant Editing** setting to **Yes**.
2. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, choose an item type from the **Engineering Data Editor** select list, for example, **Pipe Run**.
3. Ensure that **Active Drawing** is selected to display properties of the items that appear in the drawing you are currently viewing.
4. Select **Other Drawings** to display properties of the items that appear in all the non-active drawings in the plant. Selecting this option also displays items in the drawing stockpiles of the other drawings.
5. Edit the data in the cell (field) in accordance with the data type: For text, select the cell and just type the required value.

For a list of values (or equivalent quantitative values with different units of measure), double-click the cell and select the required value from the drop-down list that becomes available.

For a field with a calculation command (ellipsis), double-click the cell and then select the ellipsis to open a dialog.

The ability to perform Plant Editing for non-active drawings only applies to the default **Engineering** **Data Editor** window. Editing item properties of non-active drawings is not supported in a new **Engineering Data Editor** window that is opened using the **Window** > **New** > **Engineering Data** **Editor** command.

While you are editing an item that belongs to another drawing, other users will only be able to open that drawing in read-only mode. In this case, the other user will receive a message that the drawing is open; (in Drawing Manager, the **Accessed By** field for that drawing shows the person who has the drawing open). To make the other drawing editable for other users, you must move the cursor out of any **Engineering Data Editor** row representing an item in the drawing. If the drawing is open as read-only, it will have to be re-opened in order to be editable.

When editing the **Plant Group Name** property in the **Engineering Data Editor** or the **Properties** window, if identical plant group names exist, holding the mouse pointer over a selected value from the list displays a tool tip showing the plant group hierarchy path for that value. Therefore, if two units named U1 are available in the list, displaying the tool tip will show the different paths for the names; for example **\A1\U1** and **\A2\U1**.

In a project, you cannot perform Claim / Release Claim operations in the **Engineering Data Editor** for items that belong to other drawings.

Editing items from other drawings clears the Undo buffer for the active drawing.

Editing items from other drawings creates out-of-date model items, which can be updated using the **Out-of-Date Drawings** > **Update** command. See Update Command (File > Out-of-Date Drawings Menu) in Drawing Manager Help.

If you use Plant Editing to change a property value in a non-active drawing, propagation occurs according to the System Editing rules defined for the plant and the **Engineering Data Editor** display is automatically updated. This includes propagation of data between non-active drawings across Off-Page Connectors (OPCs) when both drawings involved are not opened by a user. Propagation does *not* occur across OPCs between the active drawing and a non-active drawing.

In the **OPC** view in the **Engineering Data Editor**, it is not possible to edit OPC properties in non-active drawings; however, OPC properties in the active drawing or in the plant or active drawing stockpiles can be edited.

If a property value in the **Engineering Data Editor** is changed by the user or as a result of an automatic update and this property is used for sorting, the software does not update the sort order of the data automatically if the values are no longer in the correct order.

Certain restrictions exist for editing items in the **Engineering Data Editor** where those items belong to other drawings. These restrictions are summarized in the following table.

If a property value in the **Engineering Data Editor** is changed by the user or as a result of an automatic update and this property is used for sorting, the software does not update the sort order of the data automatically if the values are no longer in the correct order.

**Batch Replace Properties that Include Units of Measure Using Plant Editing** This option applies where the cell contents have identical values and units of measure.

1. On the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar, choose an item type from the select list, for example, **Pipe** **Run**.
2. Select the scope for the display of the data (**Active Drawing**, **Other Drawings**, stockpiles).
3. If needed, apply a filter to display only the data rows with identical values and units of measure.
4. Select a field with the preferred value, and select an alternative format from the list. This changes to the equivalent value in the new units of measure. For example, 50 psi becomes 2.4 bar g. You can also change to a different format for the *same*  units of measure; for example, where 50 psi becomes 50.254 psi.
5. Right-click in the field from which you want to copy data and select **Copy** on the shortcut menu.
6. Select the field to which you want to copy data, or hold down SHIFT while selecting several consecutive fields in a column.

**Actions Menu (Engineering Data Editor)**

Contains commands for placing multiple representations of an item, deleting stockpile items, or moving items between stockpiles. Select the down-arrow next to the **Actions** menu to display the available commands.

**Place Multiple Representation Command**

Allows you to place a second instance of an equipment item in a second drawing.

This command is not available in Smart P&ID Engineering.

**Delete Stockpile Item Command**

Removes the stockpile item from the plant model completely. The item and its properties are deleted from the database and can no longer be placed in a drawing, regardless of the settings in Options Manager or Catalog Manager.

In case of a connector, this command is not available unless the partner connector is in one of the stockpiles.

For equipment components, the **Engineering Data Editor** view does not include a filter for Item Status = ‘Active’ (unlike other item types). Therefore the row corresponding to the item that was deleted from the stockpile is still shown in the view but becomes read-only after refreshing the **Engineering Data Editor** display; the item is removed from the display only when you close and reopen the drawing.

After deleting a stockpile item from the model, you can restore it to the stockpile (and then to the drawing) using the **Edit** > **Undo** command on the main menu, unless you have performed one of the actions that clears the Undo buffer. See Undo Command (Edit Menu).

**Using Catalog Explorer**

**Catalog Explorer** is an interface used to view and manipulate an electronic catalog containing catalog items and their associated properties. Catalog items may be drawing symbols or labels. Conceptually, **Catalog Explorer** resembles a manufacturer’s catalog with pictures of parts to build a plant. The catalog contains items organized by categories represented by the folder structure under the **Symbols** folder in the reference data and also items designated by users as Favorites. **Catalog Explorer** includes the following features for easy navigation:

Favorites section

Quick Catalog

Flags used to mark catalog items for searching

The **Catalog Explorer** display is turned off by default the first time you launch Smart P&ID

Engineering.

The following issues can occur when opening a drawing in Smart P&ID Engineering: The first time **Catalog Explorer** is opened for a new plant, it displays in a disabled state.

If a symbol is added or updated in **Catalog Manager**, the symbol appears as disabled in **Catalog Explorer**.

These display problems usually occur because the user has read-only access rights to the Smart P&ID Engineering reference data folder. To fix them, an administrator with ‘Full Control’ permissions in Options Manager must run the **Generate Symbol Images** command in Options Manager in order to update the symbol images and the CatalogExplorerSettings.bin file in the reference data folder. See Generating Symbol Images.

**Navigating in Catalog Explorer**

Catalog Explorer consists of the following navigational areas:

Toolbar

Tree view

Icon view / List view

**Toolbar**

The toolbar includes the following commands:

**Expand All / Collapse All**

This command is a toggle that expands or collapses items in the tree view under the currently selected folder.

**Tile Vertically / Tile Horizontally**

Toggles between the tiling of the tree view and icons or list view vertically (tree view on the left) or horizontally (tree view on top).

**Icons / List**

**Display Favorites**

Toggles between displaying only catalog items assigned to the Favorites folders or all catalog items in the selected folder including Favorites. If the **Show all Symbols** toggle command is selected, catalog items in the subfolders of the selected folder will also be displayed.

**Quick Catalog**

Toggles between displaying only catalog items assigned to the Quick Catalog or all catalog items in the selected folder including Quick Catalog items. If the **Show all Symbols** toggle command is selected, catalog items in the subfolders of the selected folder will also be displayed.

**Import**

Imports to Catalog Explorer a .bin file containing Favorites, Quick Catalog, and Flags settings.

**Export**

Exports all Favorites, Quick Catalog, and Flags settings from Catalog Explorer to a .bin file.

**Refresh**

Refreshes Catalog Explorer to reflect changes made during the session to folders or catalog items such as additions, updates, or deletions.

**Show all Symbols**

Shows or hides catalog items in the subfolders of the folder selected in the tree view.

If the selected folder includes any catalog items other than in its subfolders, then those symbols will be displayed even if you deactivate the **Show all Symbols** command.

**Search Box**

Displays the symbols that match your input. which can be either a part of the symbol name or a flag. By default, the scope of the search is on the selected folder only. To include its subfolders in the search, select the **Show all Symbols** command.

Search for the string or flag entered is canceled when you switch to another folder in the tree view or when you select a toolbar command.

Searches are case-insensitive.

**Tree View**

The tree view displays a hierarchy of nodes that contain catalog items. You can navigate through the tree view by selecting the different nodes. A small right-facing triangle to the left of the node name indicates that the node contains sub-nodes. Select the node to expand it. To close a node, select the triangle to the left of the open node name. If the selected node contains any drawing symbols, the software displays them in the icon / list view.

If the **Symbols** node is not displayed in the tree view, ensure that in Options Manager, the **Catalog** **Explorer Root Path** value does not include a trailing ‘\’ (backslash) character.

**Icon View / List View**

When a folder is selected in the tree view, the icon view or list view displays all the symbols in that folder and its sub-folders, organized by item class. From these views, you can select catalog items before placing them in a drawing (for Smart P&ID only) or in a stockpile. You can specify the view style for the symbols in the list view by toggling the **Icons / List** toolbar command.

**Icon view**

Displays the catalog items as tiles. Each tile shows an image of the item, the item’s name, including the file extension (.sym for symbols or .pid for assemblies), and a tool tip with additional information. Below the image, a toolbar appears with several commands.

**List view**

Displays the catalog items in a grid, showing the following options or properties: Toolbar commands. These commands are identical to the commands that appear in the icon view.

**Navigating in the Properties Window**

**Working with the Properties Window**

The **Properties** window display is a two-column table that provides the common properties of the current selection in the active **Design** window. The active items always determine the content of the **Properties** window. You can only have one **Properties** window open. If only one component is selected, or all components are of the same type, all the properties of that type of component appear. If your select set contains components of different types, then only the common properties appear. If the selected items have different values for their common properties, the value box is blank.

You can modify the values for properties in the **Properties** window. You can display and edit relationships that involve components, component types, or assemblies.

At the top of the **Properties** window is the **Selected Items** list, which itemizes all of the selected objects individually and as a select set. You can display item properties by locating the appropriate item in the **Selected Items** list, as well as by selecting an item in the **Design** window. An item and the properties that belong to it are associated when the item is created in Catalog Manager. If more than one item is selected in the **Design** window, then the **Selected Items** list contains the choice **Select Set** as well as individual items in the set.

You can use the **Copy Bulk Properties** and **Paste Bulk Properties** buttons to copy properties from one item to another. This action can be particularly useful when correcting inconsistencies, for instance, or when you must apply changes to more than one item. The software includes a default set of bulk properties, but you can change those properties specified as bulk in the **Usage** box on the **Layout** tab of the **Advanced** **View Properties** dialog.

If you copy or paste values in the grid area, use CTRL + C and CRTL + V. Do not use the **Edit** > **Copy**, **Edit** > **Paste**, or **Edit** > **Cut** menu commands to modify property values in this grid.

**Display > Properties Window Command**

Turns the display of the **Properties** window on or off.

**Properties Window Command (View Menu)**

The properties that are subsequently displayed in the window belong to the chosen item or the select set. For the select set, only properties that all items have in common appear, and only common values are displayed for those properties. Consequently, empty property values for a select set do not necessarily mean that no value has been assigned for any of the items in the set, only that either no value has been assigned or that the different items have different values for the property.

Whenever you have constructed a select set, you can choose single items from that set by using the **Selected Items** list at the top of the **Properties** window. A single item chosen in a select set this way is highlighted in a different color in the Drawing view.

**Review and Edit Item Properties**

1. Select the item or items whose properties you want to review.
2. Select **Edit** > Properties to display the **Properties** window.
3. Enter or edit information in the cell next to the appropriate property.

You can review and edit item properties in the **Engineering Data Editor**. You can edit the contents of some cells directly in the table if the corresponding property is not read-only or generated strictly by validation, or you can select an item by selecting the icon in the left-most column and then edit its properties in the **Properties** window.

For formatted properties, such as estimated length or maximum operating temperature, you can enter a value without a format. Use a single quote, ’, at the beginning of your entry. In this way, you can enter free text into a formatted property and no units of measurement are assigned.

**Associate an Item with a Plant Group**

When an item is placed in a drawing, the plant group type and the plant group name under which the drawing resides are assigned to the item by default. See Editing Plant Group Properties . To associate an item to a different plant group:

1. Select the item that you want to associate with a different plant group. The default plant group is the node in the plant hierarchy immediately under which the drawing resides.
2. In the **Properties** window, select the plant group type in the **Plant Group Type** property box.

Not all item types support the plant group property.

To associate your item with a different unit, modify the plant group name in the **Plant Group Name** property box.

If identical plant group names exist, holding the mouse pointer over a selected value from the list displays a tool tip showing the plant group hierarchy path for that value. Therefore, if two units named U1

are available in the list, displaying the tool tip will show the different paths for the names; for example

**\A1\U1** and **\A2\U1**.

**Copy Bulk Properties**

1. In the **Design** window or **Engineering Data Editor**, select the item whose bulk properties you want to copy.

**Customizing the Software**

Customization allows you to modify and enhance the software to meet your specific needs. You can use standard Windows programming tools and languages that are OLE-aware, such as Microsoft® Visual Basic®. Several ways to customize the software are available:

**Customizing with Built-In Commands**

You can add commands to a menu or a menu command to a toolbar. To add a button to a toolbar or a command to a menu, you select **Tools** > Customize. From there, you can select the **Menu** or Toolbars Tab

and select the options that you want. For example, if you frequently use the **View** > **Previous** command, you could add the **Previous View** button to the main toolbar. The **Previous View** button is listed on the

Toolbars Tab of the Customize Dialog.

If you want to create a new toolbar that does not exist in the software, you can start by selecting **View** > **Toolbars**. You then select **New** and type the name of the new toolbar on the **New Toolbar** dialog. After you select **OK**, the Customize Dialog automatically appears so that you can add buttons to the new toolbar.

**Customizing with Macros**

Not only can you add built-in commands or buttons to the software, but you can also create your own macros and add them to menus and toolbars in the same manner. The **Tools** > Customize command allows you to add macros to the standard menus and toolbars in the software. Or, you can run the macros directly by selecting **Tools** > Custom Commands and selecting the macro.

You can create the macros in Visual Basic or other OLE-aware programming applications. Some of the OLE-aware programming applications are Visual Basic for Applications, Visual C++ Delphi, Visual Basic, and so forth.

The software includes a type library, which contains all the objects, properties, and methods available with the product. Select **Help** > **Programming with Smart P&ID Engineering** to access the Smart P&ID

Engineering * Programming User’s Guide, which pro* vides a complete reference to the objects, methods, and properties. You can view the type library with the type library browser of Visual Basic or the browser for an OLE-aware programming application. Some macros also are delivered with the software; see a list by using the **Tools** > **Custom Commands** command.

**Customizing Interface Elements**

You can customize many of the various ways of interfacing with the software. Some customization options include displaying small or large icons, creating shortcut buttons to access your most commonly used items, https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 80/573

**Working with Drawings**

When you open a drawing, the drawing is displayed in a **Drawing** view in the **Design** window.

Drawings are graphical representations of plant models using standard symbols and conventions. A plant model consists of components. A component is any piece of equipment, instrumentation, piping, or other item used to create a plant model. Symbols represent components in **Catalog Explorer** and **Engineering** **Data Editor**. In the **Properties** window, you enter appropriate values into the database for each property of the component. You can use the commands on toolbars and in menus to add information to your drawing, and you can use edit commands to modify the information in your drawing.

Any changes that you make to the drawing data are automatically saved in the database. You can also save drawings in .pdf format. You cannot save a drawing as a template. The only way to use a template is to have a plant administrator select a template at drawing creation in Drawing Manager.

The following table lists the characters that cannot be used in certain names, paths, passwords, or file names throughout Smart Engineering Manager and the Engineering and Schematics products.

**Opening Existing Drawings**

The **Open** command on the **File** menu opens existing drawings. You can also change databases by using this command so that you can open drawings in other plants.

The software keeps track of the drawings that you worked on last. These drawings appear at the bottom of the **File** menu. To open one of these drawings, you can select it from that list. The **Options** command on the **Tools** menu allows you to set the number of entries displayed in that list.

**Setting Up Properties for a Drawing**

An administrator sets up drawing properties such as units of measure in Options Manager and Format Manager. The drawing information is stored in a database associated with the drawings in a plant.

With the **Properties** command on the **File** menu, you can view, edit, and save properties for a drawing.

Drawing properties can include the title, the author, and keywords that identify important information. These properties include drawing statistics, such as drawing size and the date that a drawing was created and last modified; the software updates statistics automatically. You can change the name of a drawing in Drawing Manager.

Renaming a drawing file in Windows allows the drawing to be opened with all graphics pointing to the database. However, renaming a drawing file in Windows does not update the drawing table in the plant schema where the drawing name is stored.

**Working with Several Open Drawings**

Several drawings can remain open in the same session but only if they all belong to the same plant. Each drawing can have more than one view, too. You can use the **Cut**, **Copy**, and **Paste** commands to move or copy information between the drawings or within one open drawing. You can use commands on the **Window** menu to arrange all the open drawings and views so that you can see them easily.

**Units Tab (File Properties Dialog)**

Sets up units of measure and precision readout for the length, area, or angle values in a drawing.

The precision readout sets the number of significant figures to appear. It represents the accuracy of the unit readout value. The precision setting does not alter the numbers that you type into a property, it alters only the display of the numbers. Values ending in 5 are rounded up. For example, if the precision readout is .123

and you draw a line that is 2.1056 inches long, then the line value length is rounded up to 2.106 inches.

**Length Readout**

Sets the unit of measure and precision readout for the length values in a document.

**Angle Readout**

Sets the unit of measure and precision readout for the angle values in a document.

**Area Readout**

Sets the unit of measure and precision readout for the area values in a document.

When placed on a drawing, all delivered labels that include units of measure use the plant default formats defined in Options Manager, and so labels do not always display the units of measure selected in the **Properties** window. To ensure that a label displays the units of measure specified in the **Properties** window, in **Catalog Manager**, select the required label, and from the **Format** list on the **SmartText Editor** dialog, select the **As Entered** option.

The software supports round-trip conversion of units without loss of precision. That is, you can convert centimeters to meters and back and retain the originally entered value of centimeters with no round-off loss.

To avoid loss of precision in units when switching between small and large types of a particular unit, increase the precision, that is, increase decimal places, of the larger unit through Format Manager.

**Close the Program**

Select **File** > Exit.

The software checks for unsaved changes when you close the software and automatically saves the changes.

**Saving Drawings**

Whenever you save a drawing using **File** > **Save**, the software uses the name and folder location specified in Drawing Manager during drawing creation. If you want to save the drawing in.pdf format , use the **Save** **as PDF** command.

When you open an existing drawing, the software copies the drawing from the disk or network and displays it on the screen. As you work, the changes that you make to the drawing appear on your screen. These changes are saved in the database automatically.

If another user modifies an item on an open drawing using automation and you also modify the same item from Smart P&ID Engineering, on saving the drawing, you will receive a message that you must close and then reopen the drawing. All unsaved changes that you made to the drawing will be lost.

After you have saved a drawing, it remains displayed on the screen. You can use **File** > **Close** to close the drawing and clear it from your screen, or you can use **File** > **Exit** to close the drawing and quit the software.

**Saving Drawings in Other Formats**

You can save drawings as PDF files using the Save as PDF command.

You can also batch save drawings in other formats in Drawing Manager. See *Save Drawings* *in Other Formats* in the Drawing Manager User’s Help.

**Save Command (File Menu)**

Stores the active drawing. The plant location and paths are set in Smart Engineering Manager and Options Manager.

**Save a document**

If you save a document that has not previously been saved, the software automatically prompts you to indicate if you want to save the changes.

**To save the active document**

1. Go to **File** > Save command.
2. If you have made changes after the document was last saved or if you have never saved the active document, you are prompted to indicate if you want to save your changes. Do one of the following: If you do not want to save your changes, select **No**.

If you want to save the changes, select **Yes**. If you select **Yes**, the **Save As** dialog is displayed so that you can give the document a name, and specify a folder and format to save it to.

If you do not want to close the document, select **Cancel**.

**To save a document to the previous version in SmartSketch**

1. Go to **File** > Save As command (File Menu).
2. Select the drive and folder for the new document.
3. In the **File Name** box, type a new name for the document.
4. In the **Save As Type** box, select **SmartSketch 5.x (*.igr)** so it can be shared with users still using the previous version of Smart P&ID Engineering.

If you open a . *sha* file in Smart P&ID Engineering, the software will not allow you to save it to a previous version.

**To save a document in a different format**

1. Go to **File > Save As**.
2. Select the drive and folder for the new document.
3. In the **File Name** box, type a new name for the document.

If the active document is read-only, you can save changes only by saving the document with a new name.

To save files containing unavailable linked references to a previous version of the software (Smart P&ID Engineering 5.x), you must do one of the following:

Delete the SmartFrame that references the unavailable linked file.

Make the link available by restoring it to its original location, or place the linked file in the same location as the file that references the link.

**Save a Drawing in a Different Format**

1. In Microsoft Excel, open the ExportLayer.xlsx file. The location of this Microsoft Excel workbook is specified in Options Manager.
2. Assign levels or layers using alphanumeric names to ensure that graphics appear in the designated levels or layers.

You can choose more filters for the **Filter** column of this worksheet from filters in Filter Manager.

If you save your drawing to the AutoCAD format, you can name layers with any combination of alphanumeric characters.

1. Save ExportLayer.xlsx.

In addition to ExportLayer.xlsx definitions, you can also apply a display set to the drawing to specify the assignment of drawing objects to different layers and their color assignments. For details, see Notes and table below.

1. Go to **File** > **Save As**.
2. In the **Save As** dialog, select the drive and folder for the new drawing.
3. In the **File path** box, if desired, edit the name and path for the drawing file, or select **Browse** to open the **File Name and Path** window to navigate to the desired path.
4. From the **Save as type** list, select the file format that you want to use.

The value of the **Override Layers on Export** attribute in the pidacad.ini file affects the output when saving a file as AutoCAD. If symbols are exported as blocks (when the value of the **Dissolve Symbol** **to Groups** attribute is set to 0), you must specify a value of 2 or 3 for the **Override Layers on Export** attribute to ensure that the blocks are exported to the correct AutoCAD layer. For full details of the **Override Layers on Export** attribute, see Configuration File Settings for AutoCAD Translation.

When saving to AutoCAD or MicroStation, the software checks the ExportLayer.xlsx file and if it finds a reference to a filter that does not exist in the reference data, a **Filters Not Found** dialog is displayed showing a list of missing filters. When you select **Exit** to dismiss the dialog, the save as process stops.

When saving to AutoCAD or MicroStation using a display set, the software uses the ExportLayer.xlsx file only for filtering items that do not meet any of the display set filter criteria and for which the **Color** value of filtered or background items is not **None**.

Text boxes on drawings that are saved as AutoCAD drawings display a border if the fill color **Blank** is selected in the **Text Block Properties**. To remove the border around text boxes in translated AutoCAD drawings, modify the P&ID symbol in Catalog Manager and set the **Text Block Properties** fill color to **None**.

When you save a drawing in .dwg format, the text labels appear in low-resolution due to the changes made to the text width factor in RAD.

When saving a drawing to AutoCAD with SmartFrame objects such as auxiliary graphics, you must do the following to prevent a border showing around such objects:

1. In the Smart P&ID installation folder path *..\Program Files (x86)\SmartPlant\P&ID*

*Workstation\bin*, select the pidacad.dwg seed file and copy it to a location where you have write permissions.

1. Launch AutoCAD and open the copied pidacad.dwg file.
2. Under **System Variables**, set the value of the **FRAME** variable to **0**.
3. Save the change to update the pidacad.dwg file.
4. Copy the pidacad.dwg file back to the bin folder in the Smart P&ID installation path.

The dependent behavior of drawing items on the color value of display sets is as follows: https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 103/573

**Save as PDF Dialog**

Allows you to define the output settings and the file name and path for drawings that you save as PDF files.

**Resolution**

Modifies the dots per inch, or “dpi”. The greater the dpi, the better the clarity. Increasing the resolution setting increases the file size and can slightly increase the time required to process some files.

**Color options**

**Color**

Creates a PDF using the colors available in the document. You can only create a color PDF from a color drawing sheet.

**Grayscale**

Creates a PDF using a 256-color grayscale.

**Pure black and white**

Creates a PDF that has no color or grayscale. Anything that is not pure white is drawn as black.

**JPEG compression**

Compresses images embedded in your document according to the compression level you define. If your drawing contains a lot of images, compression settings are very important for achieving good image quality at a manageable file size. Use the pull-down menu to set the compression level. Compression levels in the **High quality** range do not noticeably affect image quality, and produce larger file sizes than settings in the https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 121/573

**Low quality** range. However, using a mid-range compression level usually strikes the best balance in creating a compact file while still maintaining enough information to produce high-quality images.

**Include inconsistency markers**

When selected, includes inconsistency symbols that appear on the drawing in the PDF output.

**File path**

Allows you to define the name and path for the PDF file.

**Re-creating Drawings**

Smart P&ID Engineering continually updates the database as you edit a drawing. However, the drawing file is not updated until you actually save the file (that is, when you select **File** > **Save** or when you exit Smart P&ID Engineering). Occasionally, the software might terminate abnormally due to power outages and so forth. As a result, the database is up-to-date with changes that you posted to the drawing, but the drawing file reflects the status when you last saved the drawing. When you re-open the drawing, the software recognizes that the drawing file is different from the database.

The software displays a message box that states: One or more items in this drawing are inconsistent with the database. Select **OK** to re-create the drawing from the database.’

During the re-create process, the status bar at the bottom of the main window keeps you informed about the particular elements currently reconciling with the database. Also, a log file, **Recreate-DrawingName.log**, is created in your **Temp** folder. You can check this file for irregularities that occur during the re-create process.

Do not interfere with the re-create process after it is started because the drawing can become unusable.

For best system performance, close all other applications except for Smart P&ID Engineering when running the re-create process.

During the re-create process the status bar at the bottom of the window displays updates about the particular elements currently being reconciled with the database. You can check the log file, Recreate[Drawing#].log, located in the Temp directory, for any problems that may have occurred during the re-create process.

If your reference data has changed, use the Update Drawings functionality to incorporate those changes into your existing drawings. See the Smart P&ID Engineering * * Drawing Manager Help.

After the re-create process finishes, Smart P&ID Engineering reinitializes the drawing and displays the message ‘Re-create drawing is complete’. Review the re-created drawing and resolve any errors that occurred.

**Error Conditions**

If a section of the drawing could not re-create successfully, an error condition appears on the drawing as a heavy line segment that is highlighted orange by default. Error conditions are almost always associated with a pipe or signal run and must be resolved manually.

In Smart P&ID Engineering, it is not possible to resolve such error conditions.

**Orphaned Drawing Symbols and Band-Aiding**

An orphaned drawing symbol is a symbol for which no properties appear in the **Properties** window when the symbol is selected. This occurs because the symbol is missing from the database. On opening a drawing which is in a re-create state and contains orphaned symbols, a message appears prompting you either to recreate or to band-aid the missing symbols. Selecting **OK** will automatically delete orphaned symbols in the drawing. To band aid the symbols, select **Cancel**. The next time you open the drawing, the message will appear again and the symbols will be band-aided. Band-aided symbols are indicated by heavy orange lines.

It is not possible simply to delete orphaned symbols manually from a drawing.

**Re-create a Drawing**

1. Open the drawing that you want to re-create.
2. Set a heat trace medium for an item in the drawing.
3. Right-click an empty space on your Windows taskbar, and then select **Task Manager**.
4. Select the **Processes** tab.
5. In the list, select **draft.exe**.
6. Select **End Process**.
7. In Smart P&ID Engineering, open the drawing that you opened in step 1.
8. When the software prompts you that a re-create is necessary, select **OK** to re-create the drawing from the database.
9. Remove the heat trace medium that you set in step 2.
10. Save the drawing.

Normally Smart P&ID Engineering re-creates drawings automatically when it detects a discrepancy between the drawing and the database.

For more information about re-creating drawings, see the **Re-creating Drawings** section in the Smart P&ID Engineering Installation and Upgrade Help.

**Using Filters**

You can use filters in many ways throughout the software and its stand-alone applications and utilities.

You can use filters when you create report templates to display particular items on a report. You can use filters in Rule Manager to define how items interact within a view. You can associate filters with the source or target properties in rules. You can also use filters to find items.

You can create filters to control the display of hierarchy items in Drawing Manager. These filters are not saved to any folder in Filter Manager, but the methods of creating these filters are the same as those for creating filters saved in Filter Manager.

If you are using a Workshare environment and you are at a satellite site, do not create Project Filters at a satellite site. However, you can always create My Filters in the Filter Manager or **Select Filter** dialog environment.

**New Filter Dialog**

Allows you to specify compound or simple filter when you create a new filter. You activate this dialog by selecting **New** on the **Select Filter** dialog.

**Compound filter**

Combines two or more simple filters to return a collection of items based on the criteria of the combination of simple filters.

**Simple filter**

Returns a collection of items based on the filter definition and criteria of a single filter.

**Filter Properties Dialog**

Specifies properties of a filter, including the name, description, and the other properties for which you want to filter. Each item type owns a set of properties. Examples of item types are **Equipment**, and **Instrument**, and examples of properties for these item types are **Equipment Type**, **InstrLoop Part Number**, and **Estimated Length** respectively.

**Name**

Specifies the filter name. The name can be any combination of characters and any length. Filter names within a plant must be unique. This name appears as the filter name on the Filter Manager interface.

**Set as asking filter**

Select this check box to define the filter as an asking filter. When an asking filter is invoked on its own or as part of a display set, you are prompted to change the values in the **Operator** and **Value** fields for the filter properties. Clear the check box to define the filter as a regular simple filter.

**Description**

Allows you to specify a phrase or sentence about the filter. The description can be any combination of characters and any length. The description appears as a ToolTip when you point to the filter name on the Filter Manager interface.

**Filter for**

Contains the top-level items from the Data Dictionary. This area allows you to specify available properties in the **Definition** grid.

**Definition**

Displays all defined criteria associated with a filter. To add to or modify the definition list, you must select a line in the list and then define or edit the property in the **Edit** group.

**Match all**

Specifies that only items matching ALL of the filtering criteria pass through the filter.

**Match any**

Specifies that items matching any one or more of the filtering criteria pass through the filter. **Match any** is the default matching method.

**Add**

Places a new entry at the end of the existing definition list and enables the options in the **Edit** group so you can edit the new entry.

**Delete**

Removes the selected criterion from the definition list. This button is available only when you select a criterion in the definition list.

**Edit**

Allows you to define or edit a single line of filter definition criteria.

**Property**

Displays a list of all properties for a certain item type. Examples of properties include **Equipment Type**, **Instrument Loop Item Tag**, and **Estimated Length**. You define or modify filtering criteria by selecting a property, an operator, and a value.

**Operator**

Specifies the relationship between the property and its value. Examples of relationships include greater than (>), equal to (=), and not equal to (<>).

If a string property is being filtered or a wildcard character is being used, only the ‘equal to’ (=) operator is valid as a selection. When a wildcard character is used, the ‘equal to’ operator actually behaves as a ‘like’ operator.

**Value**

Lists appropriate values for the property specified in the **Property** list. If a list of attributes is not already associated with the **Value** box, you must type a value, which can be free text, or choose null. You can use a percent sign (**%**) as a wildcard character to find multiple characters or an underscore (_) as a wildcard character for a single character. Do not use an asterisk (*****) in the **Value** box.

If you are defining the **Engineering Data Editor**, the criteria that you enter on the **Filter** tab on the **Advanced View Properties** dialog are combined with the base filter that you select.

**Add Compound Filter / Compound Filter Properties Dialog**

A compound filter consists of more than one simple filter. Simple filters are added to the compound filter by dragging the simple filter to the compound filter folder or by creating new simple filters under the compound filter in the filter hierarchy. Compound filters apply only to homogeneous item types. This dialog specifies the properties of a compound filter, including the name, description, and whether to match all or any of the simple filter criteria.

**Name**

Specifies the filter name. The name can be any combination of characters and has no length limit. Filter names within a plant must be unique. This name appears as the filter name in the Filter Manager interface.

**Description**

Specifies a phrase or sentence about the filter. The description can be any combination of characters and has no length limit. The description appears as a ToolTip when you point to the filter name in the Filter Manager interface.

**Filter method**

Allows you to decide whether items must meet all or only one criterion to pass through the filter.

**Match all**

Specifies that items matching ALL of the filtering criteria pass through the filter.

**Match any**

Specifies that items matching any one or more of the filtering criteria pass through the filter. **Match any** is the default matching method.

**Select Filter Dialog**

Defines options for items using definitions associated with a filter. Using this dialog, you can create a new filter or modify an existing filter. Filters can also be automatically created using the **Create Auto Display** **Set** command. The auto filters created are shown in the **Auto Filters** folder that appears under the **Plant** **Folders**.

**Working with P&IDs in Smart P&ID Engineering**

With Smart P&ID Engineering, you can easily perform the tasks required to create a detailed plant model.

Smart P&ID Engineering provides multiple views of a central, unified data structure that represents the plant model. The plant model is the computer representation of the conceptual design in its entirety, including all plant components and their relationships. By manipulating model views, you can organize the information within the plant model to better understand and maintain the data. A view is a visual presentation of the data that composes the plant model. A view can be a schematic drawing, a table, or a report.

In the **Properties** window, you can add values for various properties of each item.

As you work on your drawing, you can monitor any inconsistencies in your design by reviewing the inconsistency indicators. These indicators appear in your drawing as soon as an inconsistency occurs in the design. You can resolve inconsistencies using solutions from the **Consistency Check** dialog.

Additionally, you can generate reports to help you keep track of information in the drawing. For example, after you finish the drawing, you can generate order lists for the components in the drawing. You can print the drawing, if necessary.

**Understanding Database Constraints**

The following database constraints improve the integrity of the data associated with your design.

**Foreign Key**

Insures that the corresponding value, unless it is null, exists in the table referenced by the foreign key. This type of constraint is used to enforce logical relationships, such as the plant item to plant group relationship.

**Foreign Key** in conjunction with **Not Null**

Enforces group relationships, such as the case to model item relationship. This constraint is similar to the **Foreign Key** constraint described above but does not allow null values to persist.

**Foreign Key** with **Not Null** and **Unique**

Enforce all subclass and one-to-one relationships, such as the pairing of OPCs. This constraint is similar to the **Foreign Key** constraint described above but does not allow null values to persist and requires that all values be unique.

The constraints so far described serve to enforce relationship integrity. Because the relationship, the object, and the foreign key it points to, already exists in the database or is created during your transaction, the constraints are satisfied without changing the scope of your transaction.

**Check**

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 129/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Used for more complex data integrity controls, such as monitoring conditions on multiple items. For example, History records can pertain to either a drawing or the model. Either of these objects can be null, but not both of them. A **Check** constraint enforces this condition by using comparisons and exclusions.

Another candidate for a **Check** constraint is the enforcement of certain values for one or more items. For example, invalid null or zeros assigned to properties are tested against **Check** constraints.

**Selecting Drawing Items**

To select an item, you can use the **Select Tool** on the main toolbar. You can select pipe routes, equipment, valves, labels, and so forth, and you can select item groups or assemblies.

**Selecting Single Items**

To select an item, select the **Select Tool**

on the main toolbar. When you select the **Select Tool**, the

pointer changes to an arrow with a locate zone indicator at the end:

. As you pause on items in a

drawing, the items appear in the highlight color. When an item is highlighted, select to select it.

When you select an individual item, the item changes to the selection color. You can change the selection color with the **Tools** > **Options** command.

You can also select drawing items by first selecting them in the **Engineering Data Editor**. The corresponding items are selected in the Drawing view if they reside in the active drawing.

**Selecting Multiple Items**

You can select more than one item at a time by selecting **Select Tool** and then holding CTRL or SHIFT

as you select the items that you want to select. Additionally, you can use the **Select Tool** and then drag to fence items.

When you select multiple items or grouped items, the items change to the selection color.

You can use the Select Tool Ribbon to choose if you want to select only items completely enclosed by the

fence or any item that is partly enclosed by the fence.

You can also use **Polygon Fence Locate**

to create a polygon shaped fence to select multiple items.

If you select multiple items in the **Engineering Data Editor**, these items are also selected in the active drawing, if they reside there. You construct a select set using the **Engineering Data Editor** in this way.

Whenever you have constructed a select set, you can choose single items from that set by using the **Selected Items** list at the top of the **Properties** window. A single item chosen in a select set this way is highlighted in a different color in the Drawing view.

**Canceling the Selection of Items**

To cancel the selection of an item or group of items, select any empty point on the drawing.

**Assigning Heat Tracing and Jacketing**

In Smart P&ID Engineering, you can assign heat tracing to pipe runs and to certain other plant items. The following types of heat tracing can be assigned:

Single heat trace

Double heat trace

Jacketed heat trace

The general workflow for making heat trace definitions is as follows: 1. Define heat trace media in Data Dictionary Manager by adding entries to the **Heat Trace Medium** select list.

1. Define the line style of each heat trace medium on the Options Manager **Tracing** tab.
2. Define the type of heat tracing on the Options Manager **Settings** tab by doing one of the following: For a single heat trace, ensure that the heat trace medium does not appear beside **Heat Tracing** **Media - Double Heat Trace** or **Heat Tracing Media - Jacketed Pipe**.

For a double heat trace, assign the heat trace medium to **Heat Tracing Media - Double Heat** **Trace**.

For a jacketed heat trace, assign the heat trace medium to **Heat Tracing Media - Jacketed** **Pipe**.

The implementation and positioning of heat trace or jacketing graphics depends on the heat tracing type and whether the heat tracing is applied to a pipe run or some other item type. The following table summarizes the behavior.

**Type of Heat Tracing**

**Behavior when Applied to Pipe Run**

**Behavior when Applied to Other Item Types**

Single

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

If, in Catalog Manager, no graphics are defined on the **Heat Trace** layer of a symbol, no heat trace will be displayed for the symbol in the drawing if a single or double heat trace is assigned and the item type of the symbol is anything other than Pipe Run.

If, in Catalog Manager, no graphics are defined on the **Jacket** layer of a symbol, no heat trace will be displayed for the symbol in the drawing if a jacketed heat trace is assigned and the item type of the symbol is anything other than Pipe Run.

If, in Catalog Manager, the item type of the symbol is Pipe Run, any graphics defined on the **Heat** **Trace** or **Jacket** layers are ignored.

In the drawing, the heat tracing line style of the selected heat trace medium for *all* item types is determined by the definition made on the Options Manager **Tracing** tab.

If a heat tracing medium that has been designated as jacketed is assigned to a *pipe run* in Smart P&ID Engineering, additional jacketed properties are displayed in the **Properties** window under the **Piping Jacket** category for that pipe run. If the heat trace medium is removed from the pipe run or is changed to something other than a jacketed heat trace, the **Piping Jacket** category and the associated properties are no longer displayed, and any values assigned to those properties are removed. In Data Dictionary Manager, you can add more jacketed properties if more are needed.

In Insulation Manager, you can define a heat trace medium to automatically be assigned with a particular insulation spec for a pipe run or equipment. Only the defined heat trace medium can be used in combination with that insulation spec. You can also choose one of the following options: **Undefined**

No heat trace can be used if that particular insulation spec is assigned.

**Ignore**

Any heat trace can be used with that specified insulation spec.

**Create a New Heat Tracing Medium**

1. From the **Tracing Media** list, locate the new media and select the **Style** box.
2. Select a new heat tracing style from the list.
3. Select Save .

To designate a heat tracing medium as a double heat trace or jacketed heat trace, select **Settings** in Options Manager and add the heat tracing media to one of the following: Add heat tracing media designated as double to the **Heat Tracing Media - Double Heat Trace** row, with each value separated by a comma.

Add heat tracing media designated as jacketed to the **Heat Tracing Media - Jacketed Pipe** row, with each value separated by a comma.

Any changes made to a heat trace medium in Options Manager are not reflected in any drawing in which that heat trace medium was already assigned to an item. For changes to be reflected in the drawings, you must run the **Update Drawings** command first. See Update Command in Drawing Manager Help.

**Define Heat Tracing Graphics for an Item**

1. Open **Catalog Manager**.
2. In Catalog Explorer, find the item (for example, equipment) for which you want to define heat tracing.
3. Double-click the item to open the symbol, as shown in the example.
4. In the **View** window, select the **Graphics** layer, then while holding down the CTRL key, select the **Heat** **Trace** layer. This action makes both layers visible at the same time.
5. Using the drawing tools, draw the heat trace around the symbol.

To display the **Heat Trace** layer only, select any layer *other than* the **Graphics** or **Heat Trace** layer, then select the **Heat Trace** layer.

1. Select **Save**.

The actual style of the heat tracing graphics displayed in the drawing depends on the line style chosen for the specified heat trace medium in Options Manager. See Create a New Heat Tracing Medium.

**Modify the Offset Distance of Heat Trace Lines**

The heat trace line offset is modified by setting the offset value in the line style properties for an individual heat trace. The offset value has to be modified for every heat trace line style for which the offset change is required. The workflow is as follows:

1. Create a new symbol in Catalog Manager to be used to edit the line style and import the changes back into the ProjectStyles.spp file.
2. Reference the ProjectStyles.spp file.
3. Import line styles to be edited from the ProjectStyles.spp file into the symbol file and setting the offset to the needed value using Line Style Editor.

1. Import the updated line style from the symbol file back into the ProjectStyles.spp file in Options Manager.
2. Update drawings in Drawing Manager.

Unlike the default offset distance, a user-defined additional heat trace offset distance will not change dynamically as the zoom level changes in the Smart P&ID Engineering drawing view. It is recommended to turn on the **Display as printed** option (**Tools** > **Options** > **General**) in Smart P&ID

Engineering to get a consistent look for the offset. This limitation will not affect the print-out results of the drawings.

This procedure has no impact on the heat trace line offset in translation output files (.dwg / .dxf / .dgn) created by the Smart P&ID Engineering **Save As** feature.

**Assign Heat Tracing to an Item**

1. Select the pipe run, piping component, equipment, equipment component, nozzle, or instrument for which you want to specify heat tracing.
2. In the **Properties** window, specify values for the **HT Medium**, **HT Medium Temp**, and **HT**

**Requirement** properties.

If you have already specified insulation properties for the item, you cannot subsequently assign heat tracing properties unless the default heat trace medium was set to **Ignore** for the specified insulation spec.

If you assign heat tracing to an item before you assign insulation properties, your choices of insulation properties and specifications are restricted.

The **HT Medium** and **HT Requirement** properties are available from select lists. When you type the temperature value for the **HT Medium Temp** property, the software associates the default unit of measure with the value unless you specify a different unit of measure. Select list values are defined in Data Dictionary Manager; Format Manager contains definitions for temperature units.

The location of the heat tracing graphics for piping components, equipment, equipment components, nozzles, or instruments is determined using the **Heat Trace** layer in C**atalog Manager**.

In Options Manager, you can define the heat trace symbology. You can also specify whether a particular heat trace medium is defined as a single or a double heat trace. This affects the way the symbology is applied, as shown in the following examples.

Pipe run, valve and nozzle with single heat trace medium:

**Create a New Jacketed Property for Pipe Runs**

Jacketed properties are those properties that appear under the **Piping Jacket** category. Jacketed properties that come shipped with the software have the **J_** prefix; however, you can also create new jacketed properties if needed.

1. In Data Dictionary Manager, **Pipe Run** n the **Database Tables** tab.
2. Select **Edit** > **Add Property**.
3. On the **Add Property** dialog, enter all the information as needed. For the **Display Name** value, you might want to use the **J_** prefix or some other identifier to identify the property as jacketed.
4. Beside **Category**, select **Piping Jacket** from the list.
5. Select **OK** to close the **Add Property** dialog.
6. On the toolbar, select **Save** .

For a pipe run, the **Piping Jacket** category and all properties created under the **Piping Jacket** category are only displayed in the **Properties** window when a **Jacketed** heat tracing value is assigned to the item in the **Properties** window.

**Assign a Jacketed Heat Trace to an Item**

1. Select the pipe run, piping component, equipment, equipment component, nozzle, or instrument that you want to specify as being jacketed.
2. In the **Properties** window, select a value for the **HT Medium** that is defined as jacketing.
3. Select values for the **HT Medium Temp** and **HT Requirement** properties.

1. For a pipe run, enter values for the piping jacket properties, which begin with **J_**.

For a pipe run, if you have already specified insulation properties, you cannot subsequently assign jacketed pipe properties unless the default heat trace medium was set to **Ignore** for the specified insulation spec.

If you define a pipe run as jacketed, you can no longer assign values for regular insulation properties and specifications. If you want to specify insulation property values for the jacketed pipe, you must assign those values using the properties that have the **J_** prefix, which apply only to a jacketed pipe run.

The **HT Medium** and **HT Requirement** properties are available from select lists. When you type the temperature value for the **HT Medium Temp** property, the software associates the default unit of measure with the value unless you specify a different unit of measure. Select list values are defined in Data Dictionary Manager; Format Manager contains definitions for temperature units.

The location of the jacketed graphics for piping components, equipment, equipment components, nozzles, or instruments is determined using the **Jacket** layer in **Catalog Manager**.

Options Manager contains the symbology definitions and settings for defining the heat trace medium as a pipe jacket. This affects the way the symbology is applied to items. In the following example, graphics were added to the **Jacket** layer in **Catalog Manager** for the inline valve only, therefore jacketed symbology is displayed only for the valve and the pipe run, but not for the nozzle and the vessel.

When you select a nominal diameter value for a pipe run, the software assigns the minimum value for the jacket nominal diameter (as defined on the **Pipe Jacket Nominal Diameter** dialog table in Options Manager) to the **J_Nominal Diameter** property of the pipe jacket. Also, the software only allows combinations of core pipe nominal diameter and pipe jacket diameter that are consistent with the values in the table.

**Using Piping Components**

Piping components are graphic elements that represent processes or functions within a particular piping segment. Piping components include valves, flanges, reducers, and strainers. In drawings, piping components are connected with lines.

The software includes a standard group of piping component symbols.

**Using the Piping Specification Utility**

The Piping Specification Utility (PipeSpec) works with PDS 3D, Smart 3D, or Smart Reference Data to validate the piping materials class with the temperatures, pressures, and diameters assigned to the pipe run and to search commodity codes (in all product databases) and fabrication categories (in PDS 3D databases only) for inline piping components. The database tables and library files in the products provide source information for the validation and search. The service limits validation and automatic commodity code lookup can be disabled simultaneously using a switch in Options Manager. See Configure Piping Specification Settings in the Options Manager Help..

For more information about using the Piping Specification Utility with Smart 3D, refer to the Smart P&ID Engineering Installation and Upgrade Help for details about installing **Smart 3D Piping Specification** **Remote Access Client**.

In Data Dictionary Manager, the **ValidateNomDiam.ForeignCalc** program ID, which is assigned to the **Nominal Diameter** property, starts the Piping Specification Utility and triggers the commodity code and fabrication category look-ups when a nominal diameter is changed. See Enter Required ProgIDs.

To use the Piping Specification Utility with Smart 3D, you must install the Smart 3D Piping Specification Remote Access Client, which is available on the Smart P&ID Engineering product media under **Prerequisite Software**.

To use the Piping Specification Utility with Smart Reference Data, you must first enable .NET

Framework 3.5 under Windows Features.

**PDS 3D Files Used for PipeSpec**

**pd schema** — pdtable_102 table

**ra schema** — pdtable_201 and pdtable_202 tables

**library files** — us_pjstb.l, us_pjstb.l.r, and us_pjstb.l.t (The library file locations are listed in pdtable_102.)

**.dll files** — PipeSpec.dll, pdpjs.dll, pdpjsx.dll, and ValidateServiceLimits.dll The Piping Specification utility allows separate logon for the **ra** and **pd** schemas in the PDS 3D database.

All of the displayed text strings are maintained as Visual Basic resources in the **PipeSpec.dll** file.

These strings can be translated or modified as required using a resource file editor.

When performing piping materials class validations, commodity code lookup, or validation of nominal diameter for Smart 3D or Smart Reference Data, the Piping Specification Utility assigns the highest https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 144/573

revision number from the Smart 3D or Smart Reference Data piping materials class to the **Pipe Spec** **Revision** property.

Error messages are placed in the PipeSpecError.log file in the folder assigned to the TEMP

environment variable. Error messages help you identify the cause of failure when the utility does not complete the tasks as expected. For example, if minimum requirements are not met for the look-up, the missing properties are listed in the log file.

The **ServiceLimits.log** file contains any errors encountered during the Service Limit Validation process, which runs as part of the Piping Specification Utility.

**Performing Service Limits Validation**

The Piping Specification Utility verifies that the temperatures and pressures assigned to a pipe run comply with the service limits associated with the selected Piping Materials Class. In continuous validation mode, which is activated by assigned settings in Options Manager, this verification occurs each time you modify either the Piping Materials Class or a temperature-pressure pair in the process case data of the pipe run.

The Service Limits validation requires at least one complete temperature-pressure pair from among design, alternate design, operating, and alternate operating cases. If any temperature-pressure pair violates the service limits of the selected Piping Materials Class, a warning displays the appropriate pair. This warning appears in the design software by appending an error string (‘SERVICE LIMITS ERROR’) to the name of the Piping Materials Class.

In Smart 3D, for a particular temperature-pressure pair, the service limits might also specify an accepted range of nominal diameters for the pipe run. In such cases, if the nominal diameter lies outside this range or if no value is specified for the nominal diameter, the warning also displays.

**Performing Commodity Code and Fabrication Category Look Up**

The Piping Specification Utility (PipeSpec) looks up the **Commodity Code** property (in all product databases) and the **Fabrication Category** property (in PDS 3D databases only) of inline piping components. In the continuous validation mode, this look-up occurs each time the **Piping Materials Class** or any of the case temperatures: **Design Max Temp**, **Design Min Temp**, **Operating Max Temp**, or **Operating Min Temp** are modified on the pipe run (for Smart Reference Data, only changes in the **Piping** **Materials Class** or **Design Max Temp** initiate the look-up). Validation also occurs each time the **Option** **Code** or **Nominal Diameter** of the component is modified. If the modification occurs on a property of a piping component, then the look-up is restricted to that particular component, but if the modification occurs on a property of a pipe run, then the look-up encompasses every piping component on that run.

The minimum requirements to cause a look-up are that the piping components must be in a pipe run and that the PMC and the nominal diameter of the pipe run must be specified. If temperatures do not comply with the service limits, then the **Commodity Code** property displays an error message.

The Piping Specification Utility uses process case temperatures of the run during the commodity code lookup only if the code for the component has a maximum temperature limit value in the Smart 3D or Smart https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 145/573

Reference Data database. For example, in PDS 3D, a value of -9999 for maximum temperature in pdtable_202 indicates a null value and the process case temperatures on that pipe run are ignored for the look-up. If a maximum temperature limit exists for a component, then the look-up ensures that none of the relevant process case temperatures assigned in Smart P&ID Engineering to the pipe run in which the piping component resides exceed this limit.

The units for the PDS 3D maximum temperature are those specified in Options Manager.

If continuous validation is turned on for the PipeSpec utility, then a pipe run with temperature-pressure limits that do not agree with its PMC generates **Error in PMC** in the commodity code for an inline component.

If any temperature values for the pipe run are unspecified, then for Smart Reference Data or PDS 3D, a value of zero Deg-K is assumed for each of the unspecified temperatures. For Smart 3D, an unspecified temperature is interpreted as ‘undefined’.

Smart 3D can validate commodity codes using the four case temperatures listed earlier against Maximum Temperature ranges or Minimum Temperatures specified on piping components in the Smart 3D database.

Smart Reference Data can validate commodity codes using the pipe run’s Design Max Temp against Maximum Temperatures specified on piping components in the Smart Reference Data database.

Other case maximum temperatures or minimum temperatures will not be used in the validation.

If the temperature falls within the allowable limits, the software will return a commodity code; otherwise, **Not in Spec** is returned.

Smart Reference Data supports a *single* maximum temperature only for each option code.

Smart Reference Data does not return a commodity code for reducers.

The **Fabrication Category** property of inline piping components is a select-listed property in Smart P&ID Engineering. A relationship between the fabrication category and the commodity name can be defined in the PDS 3D database. The **Commodity Name** is a unique name for every symbol. In PDS

3D, this unique name is the **AABBCC Code** property. In Smart P&ID Engineering, the commodity name corresponds to the **Short Value** entry of the **Piping Component Type** select list for the symbol defined in Data Dictionary Manager and it is this value of the commodity name that is used for the look-up. For a delivered symbol, the **Short Value** entry is equivalent to the symbol’s **AABBCC Code**, defined in Catalog Manager.

Similarly, the **Option Code** property is a select list of text values in Smart P&ID Engineering, while it is a set of code numbers or indices in Smart 3D. **Short Value** for the **Option Code** select list contains the Smart 3D indices corresponding to the appropriate **Option Code** text in Smart P&ID Engineering.

The Piping Specification Utility uses the entries in the **Short Value** box of the **Option Code** list to obtain the Option Code used in the Smart 3D database tables.

**Piping Specifications Dialog**

Opens when you select a pipe run in the drawing, and then select **Piping Materials Class** property > **Calc** button on the **Properties** pane. It allows you to choose a Piping Materials Class (PMC) from a piping specification.

The Piping Specifications dialog is only accessible when you configure proper settings in the Options Manager and assign relevant Program IDs in the Data Dictionary Manager. For more information, see Configure Piping Specification Settings and Enter Required ProgIDs.

**Piping Materials Class**

Lists all the PMCs available for the plant specified in the Options Manager. Depending on the settings in Options Manager, the software checks the properties of piping segments and inline components, including the service limits.

**Assign a Piping Materials Class to a Pipe Run Using the Piping**

**Specification Utility**

The Piping Specifications dialog is only accessible when you configure proper settings in the Options Manager and assign relevant Program IDs in the Data Dictionary Manager. For more information, see Configure Piping Specification Settings and Enter Required ProgIDs.

1. Select the pipe run.
2. In the **Properties** pane > **Piping Materials Class** property, select the **Calc** button.

The Piping Specifications dialog displays a list of all the available piping specifications for the plant specified in the Options Manager settings.

1. Choose the necessary PMC from the list and select **OK**.

Based on the selected PMC and other assigned properties, such as **Nominal Diameter**, **Maximum** **Design Pressure**, **Maximum Design Temperature**, and so forth, the PipeSpec utility copies properties and checks limits in the entire run, including inline components.

If you subsequently assign nominal diameters to inline valves or other components, Smart P&ID

Engineering assigns commodity codes and fabrication categories to them that correspond to the PMC

of the pipe run and the specifications in your databases (fabrication category is not supported for Smart 3D or Smart Reference Data). If you choose a diameter, for instance, that does not exist for the assigned PMC, the commodity code property becomes **Not In Spec**.

If you choose temperature-pressure limits for process cases that do not agree with the assigned PMC, then the error **Service Limits Error** is added to the PMC for the run.

Given the appropriate settings in Options Manager and Data Dictionary Manager, you can manually assign commodity codes to inline components, and the PipeSpec utility looks up accepted diameters

and validates the assignment. See Assign a Commodity Code to a Piping Component Using the

Piping Specification Utility.

**Assign a Commodity Code to a Piping Component Using the Piping**

**Specification Utility**

The Piping Specifications dialog is only accessible when you configure proper settings in the Options Manager and assign relevant Program IDs in the Data Dictionary Manager. For more information, see Configure Piping Specification Settings and Enter Required ProgIDs.

1. Select an inline component that belongs to a pipe run whose piping materials class has been defined.

See Assign a Piping Materials Class to a Pipe Run Using the Piping Specification Utility.

1. On the** Properties** pane, define **Nominal Piping Diameter** for the component.

You can verify that a commodity code (in all 3D databases) and fabrication category (in PDS 3D

databases only) have been assigned in the **Properties** window, or you can open the error log, PipeSpecError.log, if properties have not been assigned as expected.

If continuous validation is turned on for the PipeSpec utility, then a pipe run with temperature-pressure limits that do not agree with its PMC generates **Error in PMC** in the commodity code for an inline component.

With continuous validation, not only is the commodity code defined automatically, but for PDS 3D, so is the **Fabrication Category** property for the inline components, if the relationship is defined in your PDS 3D database.

Adding or changing the option code can change the commodity code, if the relationship is defined in your PDS 3D database.

If continuous validation is not activated but other appropriate settings and program IDs are assigned, you can still select the **Calc** button for the **Commodity Code** property and choose a code. However this does not verify that the component agrees with a piping specification.

For additional information about the behavior of specific 3D databases when returning commodity codes, see Using the Piping Specification Utility.

**Working with Instruments and Loops**

In Smart P&ID Engineering, you can add instruments to loops, update instrument properties with loop data, and remove instruments from loops.

**Loop Tag Dialog**

Allows you to search for and specify the loop tag for the item whose properties currently appear in the **Properties** window. This dialog opens when you select the ellipsis button next to the loop tag cell.

**Search for**

Allows you to type in descriptors to display the available loop tags, limited by parameters that you enter. The percent character, **%**, is a wildcard. For example, if you want to list only loop tags that contain the letter **F**, you can type **%F%** in the **Search for** box. If you want to display all available loop tags, simply type **%**.

**Search**

Finds and displays the loop tags that match the criteria in the **Search for** box. You can choose a tag from the main window and select **OK** to assign the tag to the item whose properties currently appear in the **Properties** window.

**Add Instruments to a Loop**

1. Select the **Catalog Explorer** tree view **Loops** node.
2. In the list view, right-click the instrument loop that you want to place.
3. Select **Send to Drawing Stockpile** or **Send to Stockpile** from the shortcut menu.
4. Define properties for the loop by entering values in the **Properties** window. The software automatically generates an item tag when you enter a tag suffix.
5. Select the item that you want to associate with the instrument loop.
6. Select the item tag of the loop from the **Loop Tag** select list in the **Properties** window, or you can select the **Calculation** button beside the **Loop Tag** property in the **Properties** window.
7. On the **Loop Tag** dialog, enter characters in the **Search for** box to display the available loop tags.
8. Select **Search Now**.
9. Choose the appropriate loop from the resulting list.

If you need to change or modify a loop, and the loop has instrument(s) already assigned to it, you can use the **Updating Associated Instruments with Loop Properties (Properties Window)** command https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 149/573

to select those instruments whose properties you want to update to match the changes in the loop.

If an instrument-loop association is attempted and the resulting instrument item tag is a duplicate, the association will be canceled and the instrument tag will retain its original value. This can occur for single or multiple instrument-loop associations.

If an association is made between a loop and a select set consisting of several instruments and the generated item tag for some of the instruments will be duplicates, no associations will be made for the duplicate instruments. A message will be displayed for each duplicate instrument indicating that the instrument tag will retain its original value.

You can assign the **Loop Tag** qualifier to instruments that are already placed in your drawing or that reside in the stockpile.

Because loops are logical collections of instruments rather than physical groupings, you do not need to place the loop symbol in the drawing itself to create an occurrence. Instead, placing the loop in the stockpile adds the loop to the model.

You can assign a group of instruments and other elements to a loop by creating a select set of them and assigning the correct loop tag for the set.

Instrument loops normally reside in a stockpile with their members residing on drawings. Moving the instrument loop itself to another stockpile has special limitations. See Move a Stockpile Item to the

Stockpile of Another Drawing.

After you create instrument loops, you can create a customized loop report to generate lists of items in specific loops in your drawing or plant, or you can open the **Engineering Data Editor** to display elements of the loop.

If you need to refresh the instrument **Loop Tag Suffix** display in the **Properties** window, clear selection of the instrument and then select it again.

If the **Properties** window is not visible, you can display it by selecting the instrument or loop and then selecting **Edit > Properties** on the main menu bar.

**Update Associated Instruments with Loop Properties Dialog**

This dialog allows you to update the Item tag property of an instrument so that it will correspond with the current Loop tag property for that instrument. You can access this dialog by selecting the ellipsis beside **Loop Function**, **Tag Seq No**, or **Tag Suffix**.

The dialog displays the list of instruments associated with that loop. The check boxes beside the tags can be selected to determine which instruments will have their **Instrument Tag** property updated.

**Remove an Instrument from a Loop**

1. In the drawing, select the item or items that you want to remove from the loop.

1. In the **Properties** window, remove the value for the **Loop Tag** property for the selection.

When an instrument is assigned to a loop, validation automatically creates an instrument item tag. If you remove the loop tag property, the instrument item tag remains the same until the instrument is assigned to a new loop.

If the **Properties** window is not visible, you can display it by selecting the item and then selecting **Edit**

> Properties.
> 

**Using Implied Items**

An implied item is an item in the database with no graphical representation in the drawing file. You can establish implied items by the existence of a single item, or by the existence of a relationship between two items.

A common example of a symbol with implied items is a vent drain (macro component) detail. In the drawing, the vent drain detail is represented graphically by only one symbol. However, when the symbol is placed, it represents a 1-inch secondary pipe, a 3/4-inch root valve, and a plug in the database.

Selecting **Edit** > **Properties** and selecting the **Implied Items** tab on the **Rule Properties** dialog allows you to define the method for specifying implied items. The list shows all implied items for a rule. You can add or delete items by using the **Add** or **Delete** buttons beside the list.

If you associate implied items with a single item on the **Items** tab (**Item 2** is freestanding), then the software creates implied items for each instance of that item in the design. If you associate implied items with a pair of items, then the software creates implied items for each instance of the relationship between those two items.

Because implied items are not graphical, you cannot see them in a drawing. However, you can display the items in the table view and in reports generated from the database.

For a detailed explanation of how to create a rule for an implied item, see the Smart P&ID Engineering Rule Manager documentation.

**Item Tag Validation**

The **Item Tag Validation** functionality is saved as *ItemTag.dll* and performs calculations and validations in the current plant for unique tag checking, automatic tag generation, and tag reformatting. **ItemTag** **Validation** can generate unique **Item Tag** values and maintains consistency between the **Item Tag** value and the properties used in its calculation. Validation, in addition to checking for existing item tags, also checks for duplicate item tags according to the scope specified by the particular version of the *ItemTag.dll* file.

Also, for properties included in the item tag, any leading or trailing spaces are removed during validation.

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The code for validating new item tag uniqueness is located in the *ItemTag.dll* file. To ensure that the software does not create duplicate item tags, you must use the appropriate version of this file according to the environment:

**ActivePlant**

(Delivered in the **Item Tag Validation** folder) Contains the delivered item tag validation code and the default ItemTag.dll with the scope set for validating item tag uniqueness in the current plant only.

**ActiveProjectAgainstAs-Built**

Contains the delivered item tag validation code and the ItemTag.dll with the scope set for validating item tag uniqueness in the As-Built and the current project.

**ActiveProjectAgainstAs-BuiltAndProjects**

Contains the delivered item tag validation code and the ItemTag.dll with the scope set for validating item tag uniqueness in the As-Built and all of its projects.

These .dll files are delivered to the Programmer’s Guide\Sample Source Code\Item Tag Validation folder on the Smart P&ID Engineering product media. These files are not installed on your computer during setup.

To use these files, you must rename the ItemTag.dll file installed on your computer (for example, rename the file to DeliveredItemTag.dll), then copy from one of the product media sub-folders (**ActiveProjectAgainstAs-Built** or **ActiveProjectAgainstAs-BuiltAndProjects**) the ItemTag.dll flavor that you want to use. Place this copy in the same location as the installed ItemTag.dll that you just renamed.

When you are finished, remove the ItemTag.dll copy, then rename the delivered copy back to its original name.

**ItemTag Validation** applies to the following item types: instrument loops, instruments, pipe runs, duct runs, equipment components, signal runs of plant item type Pipe Run (hydraulic, connect to process, and so forth), equipment (other equipment, exchangers, mechanical equipment, and vessels), rooms, and nozzles.

All other item types are disregarded.

**Default Item Tag Configurations**

The tables below show the item types that are validated or calculated by the **ItemTag Validation** and the column names where modifications trigger calculation and validation.

**Labeling**

Your main tool to add or edit text content that appears in a label is the **Properties** window. By adding or editing text, you are entering data into the database. Whenever you select a label, the corresponding labeled properties for its item appear in the **Properties** window. The same properties appear in the long list of properties when you select the item itself. Because only the label properties appear when the label is selected, you have an easier method to find to the label properties.

A label always reflects the current property values of the item that it labels. Labels that populate a property at placement are called driving labels. In other words, the predefined property value in the label overwrites the current property value on the item that it labels. Labels that do not overwrite the property at placement are called driven labels. Labels are defined as *driven* or *driving* in **Catalog Manager**.

At label creation time, the plant administrator can define text content inside the label with the SmartText editor in **Catalog Manager**. In Smart P&ID Engineering, you cannot edit text such as **OLL=** on the OLL

Elevation Equipment label. Nonetheless, you can place free text in an item note.

Different labels have different label properties. The following table identifies some of the label properties that are defined during label creation in **Catalog Manager**. After the creation of a label, these properties dictate label placement behavior for labels that were placed previously in the Smart P&ID modeler. You do not see label properties while using the design software; these properties perform their function in the background and are invisible to you.

Special notes, such as ‘1- Point’ for single-point placement, indicate that the property applies under certain conditions.

**Using Off-Page and Utility Connectors**

A connector is not actually a label but more like a component that includes a label. Placement behavior for a connector is very similar to a standard piping component label. OPCs, utility connectors, and piping components are inserted into a line.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, placement is not allowed; therefore this information refers to the behavior of items that were placed by a Smart P&ID user.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 157/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The drawing needs a connector when a process line or signal line continues on another drawing. The minimum information in the label portion is the drawing name to which the connector points and the connector number. Connectors do not have a property for flow direction, although most connectors use an arrowhead to indicate direction. When a connector is placed, it does not set or respond to flow direction.

The connector represents continuation, not connectivity or flow.

During document creation, when the first connector of the pair is placed, the software places the partner in either the Plant Stockpile or the stockpile of another drawing of your choice. The default placement for the partner is in the Plant Stockpile. When you create a connector and place it in a drawing, the property for the drawing name is not defined. The partner in the stockpile reflects the drawing name in which its match was located. When you place the partner from the stockpile, the first connector is updated to reflect the drawing name where you placed the partner connector. As a result, you never need to type a drawing name and the software guarantees a valid match.

OPC pairs have a *to* and *from* orientation. The software does not use the graphical *to* and *from* distinctions, but reading the drawing is easier for you with this differentiation.

1. The OPC is a *to* connector if its connected point appears at the *finish* end of the connector.
2. The OPC is a *from* connector if its connected point appears at the *start* end of the connector.

These properties exist for connectors:

Offset source is set to **None**.

Rotation is set to **True**.

Leader line is set to **False**.

In **Catalog Explorer**, Off-Drawing or Off-Unit OPCs are available for instruments. Two types of connectors are available for process lines: Off-Drawing or Off-Unit OPCs or Utility Connectors. The correct symbology differentiates OPCs. You define symbology in Options Manager.

**Understanding System Editing and OPCs**

For Smart P&ID Engineering, placement is not allowed; therefore this information refers to the behavior of items that were placed by a Smart P&ID user.

An OPC can be placed as a freestanding item in a drawing or it can be placed onto an existing process line or signal line (line). If an OPC has been placed as a freestanding item, a line can be attached to it. When the relationship between the OPC and the line is created (either by placing the OPC or by placing the line), the system finds the applicable rules, copies the specified properties and evaluates the consistency criteria.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 158/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

When the first OPC (of an OPC pair) is connected to a line, there is no line connected to the mate OPC.

Because there is no other line, the system will not find any applicable rules.

When the second OPC (of an OPC pair) is connected to a line, however, the system will find the rules that apply to this pair of lines. The system copies the specified properties from the line in the other drawing to the line in the active drawing. This copy operation will not overwrite any existing values. (The **Copy** is forced into the **Copy If Null** mode.) The properties that are copied across the OPC are propagated into the active drawing. This can mean that property values on items other than the connected line are affected. However, this is only done if the current value is **Null**. Existing values are not overwritten. After the copy process is complete, the consistency criteria are evaluated and inconsistencies are generated for all inconsistent properties.

Each time a drawing is opened, a routine is executed to update all of the OPCs in that drawing. Also, the relationship between the OPC and the connected line is updated. During this update, the rule base is searched to find all of the applicable rules. If the mate OPC has been connected to a new line since the last time this drawing was opened, it might find a different set of rules that apply. After finding the applicable rules, the consistency criteria are evaluated and inconsistencies are generated for all inconsistent properties. Property values are not automatically copied across OPCs during this processing. If you want to copy changed property values across OPCs, you can use the **Solutions** that are available in the **Consistency Check** dialog.

The text in the label on the OPC is also updated. If the mate OPC has been placed into a different drawing since the last time this drawing was opened, this change will be reflected in the updated label.

**System Editing and Changing Property Values Across OPCs**

When a property value is changed on a process line or signal line (line) that is connected to an OPC, it is expected that the connected line in the continuation drawing should be changed in a corresponding manner.

You can achieve this result with a workflow that *pulls* the change into the other drawing.

This workflow allows you to *pull* a changed property value across an OPC into the continuation drawing.

When a property value is changed on a line that is connected to an OPC, an inconsistency is generated at the OPC. This inconsistency indicates that the two connected lines have different values. To resolve this inconsistency, you must close the active drawing and open the continuation drawing. In that drawing, another inconsistency is shown at the mate OPC. You can double-click on that inconsistency to display the **Consistency Check** dialog. A solution is displayed to **Copy** the new value from the first drawing onto the line in the active drawing. If you apply this solution, the value is copied into the active drawing and propagated to the related items. This resolves the inconsistency in the second drawing. The next time the first drawing is opened, the inconsistency will be resolved there as well.

If you use Plant Editing to change a property value in a non-active drawing, propagation occurs according to the System Editing rules defined for the plant and the **Engineering Data Editor** display is automatically updated. This includes propagation of data between non-active drawings across Off-Page Connectors (OPCs) when both drawings involved are not opened by a user. Propagation does *not* occur across OPCs between the active drawing and a non-active drawing.

**Move Command (Edit Menu)**

Moves items from one location to another.

This command is not available in Smart P&ID Engineering.

**Move to Drawing Command (Edit Menu)**

Allows you to move a select set of drawing items into another open drawing.

This command is not available in Smart P&ID Engineering.

**Finding Drawing Items**

The software has the ability to find items and inconsistency indicators in your drawing. You can define search criteria based on a catalog item or an item type already in place in your drawing. Or, you can define criteria based on a delivered filter or on a user-defined filter. Having found all drawing items of a certain type, you can modify their properties.

The software also searches your drawing for inconsistency indicators so that you can review and correct inconsistencies systematically.

When you find drawing items, the selected items are added to a select set, and so you can view the common properties of the select set items in the **Properties** window and edit them if appropriate.

The **Find** command is not available in the **Engineering Data Editor**.

**Selecting Connected Items**

You can use the **Select Connected Items** command to navigate the line connectivity from a selected line segment to add components and other runs to a select set based on matching properties. In cases where you want the software to continue constructing a select set beyond a break in a line, for example, a nozzle, this command makes it possible to accomplish that goal.

This functionality is useful for finding branches from runs and finding all the runs and components on an entire drawing that have a common property value.

After the items are selected in the drawing, it is then a simple matter to choose the select set in the **Properties** window and continuing editing properties for not only runs, but also lines and networks and all runs included in the drawing.

The properties that define a run are specified in Options Manager.

**Select Connected Items Command (Edit Menu)**

Opens the Select Connected Items Dialog, which allows you to create a select set that includes the active

line and disconnected lines and inline components in any network. This command is available only when either a single line segment or a single component is selected on the drawing; however, after the dialog is open, you can change the selected item in the drawing and change the scope of the select set freely.

**Select Connected Items Dialog**

Allows you to construct a select set from lines and inline components, even if there are breaks in a network.

This dialog remains open until you dismiss it, and you can highlight items in the drawing and manipulate members of the select set while the dialog is active. The **Select Connected Items** command, which appears both on the **Edit** menu and on the **Line Shortcut** menu, is available only when a single line segment or a single component is selected.

**Scope**

Provides options for defining the extent of your select set. The **Scope List** allows you to choose extent, and the **Include Runs** and **Include Components** buttons allow you to incorporate different items into the select set. At no time can neither the **Include Runs** nor **Include Components** buttons be selected; that is, one or the other or both is always active.

**Scope List**

Allows you to choose from **Run**, **Line**, **Network**, and **Drawing**. The **Run** option means that lines in a single run are selected. The **Line** option selects runs that are connected at end points, including components.

If no properties are displayed in the dialog, select a line segment or component in the drawing that already has a property value you know you are interested in.

1. Select the **Preview** button to see the items that qualify according to the matching criteria chosen in the previous step. The matching items are highlighted in the Drawing view.
2. After you have selected the items you want for your select set, select **OK**. The selected items are centered in the **Drawing** view.
3. Use the **Selected Items** list in the **Properties** window to display the common properties for the select

set. See Customize the Properties Window.

If you select **Cancel**, the Select Connected Items Dialog closes, and the original item is selected in the drawing.

**Modifying Item Properties**

You can review and edit the properties of an item in the **Properties** window. You can open the **Engineering** **Data Editor** of the drawing data and in the cells of the table, edit properties of items that belong to the active drawing, other drawings, and stockpiles. You can edit the contents of some cells directly in the table if the corresponding property is not read-only or generated strictly by validation; you can copy, cut, and paste properties, too, with the same restriction. In the **Properties** window you are also constrained to edit only those properties that are not read-only.

After you have populated the properties of an item you can, for instance, run reports that display the items and their properties, or create filters and control Drawing views so that only items with specified properties are displayed,

**Equivalent Diameter and Cross Section Area Properties**

These properties apply to duct runs, ducting components, as well as to inline instruments and nozzles with ducting points. The properties are calculated as follows:

Equivalent Diameter = 1.3 * (Duct Height * Duct Width)^0.625 / (Duct Height + Duct Width)^0.25

Cross Section Area = (Duct Height * Duct Width)

The Equivalent Diameter and Cross Section Area properties are read-only.

**Editing Plant Group Properties**

When an item is placed in a drawing, the plant group type and the plant group name under which the drawing resides are assigned to the item by default. However, if you want to assign a different plant group type or plant group name to it, you can do that either from the **Engineering Data Editor** or from the **Properties** window.

You can assign a different value only to the plant group name, retaining the existing value for the plant group type. But if you assign a different value to the plant group type, plant group name is also assigned.

Based on the plant group type you select, the system assigns the first value in the corresponding plant group names list as the plant group name. For example, in the following plant group hierarchy, we have three types of plant groups – plant, area and unit.

Consider a plant item placed under **\A2\U3** which indicates that the plant group type of the item is **Unit** and the default plant group properties assigned are:

**Plant Group Type** - **A2**

**Plant Group Name** - **U3**

Now if you select the plant group type as **Area**, then** A1** is assigned as the plant group name, as **A1** will be the first name appearing in the plant group names list when you select **Area** as the plant group type.

However, you can modify it by selecting desired value from the list.

The **Plant Group Name** property is dependent on the **Plant Group Type** property and hence the **Plant** **Group Name** property cannot be assigned until the **Plant Group Type** property is assigned. If you remove the **Plant Group Type** property, then **Plant Group Name** property is also removed.

Both the **Plant Group Type** and **Plant Group Name** properties have to be assigned for an item, therefore if the **Plant Group Type** property is assigned and the **Plant Group Name** property is not available or removed for an item, the software removes the **Plant Group Type** value as follows: **Active drawing and stockpile view**: Whether the change is made in the **Properties** window or in the **Engineering Data Editor**, the **Plant Group Type** value is not removed while in the same drawing session. Refreshing the **Engineering Data Editor** does not remove the **Plant Group Type** value.

Only closing the drawing removes the **Plant Group Type** value.

**Other drawing**: If **Pagination** is enabled in **Engineering Data Editor**, then toggling the **Other** **Drawing** view removes the **Plant Group Type** value. If **Pagination** is not enabled, then refreshing the **Engineering Data Editor** removes the **Plant Group Type** value.

When copying and pasting data between cells in the **Engineering Data Editor** where one property is dependent upon another, the higher dependent (parent) property must be in a column to the left of the dependency (child) property in the layout. For example, if copying both **Fluid System** and **Fluid Code** property values from one row to one or more other rows in the **Engineering Data Editor**, **Fluid System** must be located to the left of **Fluid Code** in the layout. Likewise, if copying **Plant Group Type** and **Plant** **Group Name** properties, **Plant Group Type** must be located to the left of **Plant Group Name** in the layout.

**Modify Pump Properties by Importing a Smart P&ID Engineering Report** 1. Open a drawing that includes a pump.

1. Run the **Equipment List** report. See Generate a Report for an Active Drawing.
2. In the resulting report, change the property values as needed by updating the cells in the appropriate columns. If a property does not appear in the report, you can add it to the report template. See Define the Contents of Your Report Template.
3. Select **File** > **Save**.
4. Select **File** > **Close**.

**Moving Stockpile Items**

You can move the items that reside in stockpiles (the Stockpile, which belongs to the Plant or the active project, or drawing stockpiles) from one stockpile to another, or you can delete them from the model altogether.

You view the items in a stockpile in the **Engineering Data Editor**. In particular select **Stockpile**  to view items in the Stockpile, or select **Active Drawing Stockpile**  to view items in the stockpile of the active drawing. Be sure that the other item buttons on the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar (that is, the **Active** **Drawing** or **Other Drawings** buttons) are not active when you want to view stockpile items alone.

In the **Engineering Data Editor**, the **Actions** menu contains the following commands for manipulating stockpile items:

Delete Stockpile Item Command

Move to Different Stockpile Command

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

You can also access these commands from the shortcut menu, which opens when you right-click in the **Engineering Data Editor**. See Engineering Data Editor Shortcut Menu.

You can import items into the Stockpile, too, by importing reports with the **File** > ** Import** > **Data File** command on the main toolbar.

**Move to Different Stockpile Dialog**

Opens when you right-click a stockpile item icon in the **Engineering Data Editor** and select **Move to** **Different Stockpile**. You can move your selected stockpile item into the drawing stockpile of another drawing.

**Tree view**

Allows you to navigate in the plant hierarchy to display the drawing into which stockpile you want to move the selected item.

**List view**

Displays a list of available drawings that can accept the selected stockpile item.

**Move a Stockpile Item to the Stockpile of Another Drawing**

1. In the left-most column of the** Engineering Data Editor**, right-click the icon of the stockpile item that you want to move. Be sure you have chosen a stockpile item in your** Engineering Data Editor**, not a drawing item.
2. On the shortcut menu, select **Move to Different Stockpile** to display the Move to Different Stockpile

Dialog.

1. Choose a drawing from the list and select **OK**.

Plant item groups, such as instrument loops, packages, safety classes, and so forth, frequently reside in a stockpile with their members residing on drawings. Moving the plant item group itself to another stockpile has special limitations:

**From a drawing stockpile to the Stockpile**: No constraints apply. This action can occur at any time.

**From the Stockpile to a drawing stockpile**: If the plant item group contains only items in the destination drawing or does not contain items in any drawing, this action is allowed.

**From a drawing stockpile to another drawing stockpile**:** **Same constraint as above applies.

**Using Reports to Import Items into the Stockpile**

You can use the Equipment List and the Pipe Run List to import new items into the stockpile. This capability allows you to define values for an item that does not yet exist in the database. Both of these reports have hidden columns that store some key information that is necessary for importing this information.

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Also, you can use a report to import information for items that already exist in the database. You must first run the report, add or edit property values for the items returned in the report, and then import the items back into the drawing. The property values for the items are updated. Valid reports are Equipment List, Equipment Nozzle List, and Pipe Run List.

**Attribute Value**: Must be in double quotes, and specify the actual value, not the index number, even for select- listed values.

**AttributeUnits**: Specify if the property has units of measure, and must be a valid format;

**ITEMTAG**:Must be one of the properties listed.

The log file for import activities is called SPImport.log and is saved to your local **Temp** folder.

**Populate the Stockpile from a Spreadsheet**

1. Select **File** > **Import** > **Data File**.
2. Browse to the location of your spreadsheet, select it, and select **Open**.

The status bar at the bottom of the Smart P&ID Engineering window displays the progress of the import activity.

You can populate the stockpile with items from Aspen Basic Engineering exported spreadsheets and some Smart P&ID Engineering reports.

1. On the **Import Log** dialog, you can select **Report** to open the log file and view notes on the import process, or you can select **Close**.

If a format change is made to an exported Aspen Basic Engineering report, you must make modifications to the import code to accommodate the changed report layout.

Aspen Basic Engineering spreadsheets in either Microsoft Excel or XML format are supported. These spreadsheets include the Vessel Equipment List, Pump Equipment List, and Heat Exchanger Equipment.

Stockpile items that come from importing Aspen Basic Engineering data can be easily updated by re-importing a data file. Previously imported items, whether they remain in the stockpile or have already been placed in the drawing, are updated with data from the newly imported file.

Importing Aspen Basic Engineering XML data files allows greater flexibility when importing data into the software. All three reports: Equipment, Pumps, and Exchangers, are included in a single XML

report so that only one file has to be imported.

You can use the Equipment List, Pipe Run List, and Equipment Nozzle List Reports to define properties of items already placed in the drawing, too. Items must have an assigned item tag prior to definition or modification of properties. In addition, these reports can create occurrences of items in the stockpile.

For more information on import code and other importing parameters, see *Import Implementation* *Customization* in the Smart P&ID Engineering Programmer’s Help.

**Create a New Pump by Importing a Smart P&ID Engineering Report into the** **Stockpile**

1. Open a drawing that includes a pump with an item tag, for example, **P-100A**.
2. Run the **Equipment List** report. See Generate a Report for an Active Drawing.
3. In the resulting report, change the value in the **Item Tag** cell by highlighting the last column in the report and the column right next to it, then selecting **Format** > **Column** > **Unhide**. The path name of the associated symbol is available in column **T**. Columns **Y**, **Z**, and **AA** display the **Tag Prefix**, **Tag** **Sequence Number**, and **Tag Suffix** properties, respectively.
4. Select **File** > **Save**.
5. Select **File** > **Close**.
6. In Smart P&ID Engineering, select **File** > **Import** > **Data file**.
7. Browse to the **Equipment List** report that you just created and modified.
8. Select **Open**.

Importing new pipe runs using the **Pipe Run List** report is a little different because it also includes **SP_ID** and **Fluid Code** columns. The method above is valid, but you must be careful with row copy and paste because the layout is a little different. Additionally, you must clear the **SP_ID** value.

The delivered **Item Tag** format for pipe runs is *unit code - tag sequence number - tag suffix - fluid* *code*.

**Typicals**

A typical is a user defined, graphical representation, of a group of objects and their relationships. On a drawing, a typical marks the position of where similar groups of objects should appear but have been hidden from view. For example, on a drawing a typical that contains a series of pipes, a pump, and valves, informs the viewer that at this position on the drawing there is more than one group of objects that consist of https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 186/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

a series of pipes, a pump, and valves, but have been hidden from view to make the reading of the drawing clearer. To know exactly what the hidden objects are the viewer needs to switch views, from the primary view to the typical view. In the typical view the viewer sees all the typicals and their attributes. Though only the primary typical appears on the primary view, all the typicals and their relationships with the primary view are maintained. A typical can be repeated any number of times and can contain any objects/symbols depicted in the P&ID symbol catalog used to convey the logical plant model, including off-page connectors.

You cannot place or view the auxiliary graphics on the Typical layer.

**Typicals Common Tasks**

The following tasks are used for Typicals in Smart P&ID Engineering.

**Select a View**

When creating a typical after selecting the **Create Typical** command, the software automatically switches to the typical view. This procedure shows you how to switch between the primary and typical views, to view

already created typicals, and how to view the primary and typical views at the same time. See Select a

View.

**Comparing Drawings and Typicals**

You can compare between different versions of a drawing and its typicals using the **Tools** > **Compare and** **Refresh** command in Smart P&ID Engineering (after creating a new version in Smart P&ID Engineering Drawing Manager), or the **Version and Compare** functions of Smart P&ID Engineering Drawing Manager.

See *Working with Drawing Versions and Revisions* in the *<*  aProduct> Drawing Manager Help and

Comparing and Refreshing Versions.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, the Refresh action is not allowed.

**Print a Typical View**

This procedure shows you how to print typicals as they appear in the typicals view. You can print the view from within Smart P&ID Engineering or using Smart P&ID Engineering Drawing Manager. See Print a

Typical View.

**Create Typical Command (Edit Menu)**

**Gapping Lines**

A gap in a drawing is a condition that exists when two lines intersect graphically in the drawing but not physically in the plant.

**AutoGap Command (Tools Menu)**

Turns automatic gapping on or off in the drawing. Gapping refers to the condition that exists when two lines intersect graphically on the drawing but do not physically intersect in the plant.

This command is not available in Smart P&ID Engineering.

**Gap Now Command (Tools Menu)**

Performs gapping on the current drawing, that is, on the entire drawing. Gapping refers to the condition that exists when two lines intersect graphically on the drawing but do not physically intersect in the plant.

This command is not available in Smart P&ID Engineering.

**System Editing**

System Editing allows propagation of property values between related items. If you select **Tools** > System

Editing and a check mark displays by the command, the function is active. You can also turn on System https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 189/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Editing by selecting . When the command is active and you make changes to properties in a drawing, those changes are propagated according to relationships and rules. If the **Enable System Editing** setting is set to **Yes** in Options Manager, then every P&ID drawing in the plant will have System Editing enabled. You can turn System Editing off but when you turn it back on, it does not attempt to propagate any prior drawing changes.

If you use Plant Editing to change a property value in a non-active drawing, propagation occurs according to the System Editing rules defined for the plant and the **Engineering Data Editor** display is automatically updated.System Editing is not supported from or to plant item groups such as loops and packages.

The flow of property values is as follows.

**Properties -** The properties that can flow across this relationship are those that are listed as consistency criteria in all of the applicable rules.

**Copy and Propagate -** A property value can be copied in either direction across the new relationship and is propagated outward.

For new items, existing values are not overwritten by this process unless one item contains a Null property value. For example, if different nominal diameter values exit on both sides of a new connection, the existing nominal diameter values are not automatically changed to match unless one of the values is set to Null.

When a directional property, for example, Flow Direction and Slope Direction, is propagated, it is not enough to set the same value on all items the propagation scope. The direction of the underlying geometry must be compared to the direction of the geometry of the start item. One of the possible property values must be selected based on the direction of the geometry. In cases where the direction of the geometry cannot be compared (such as a midpoint branch condition) no propagation is possible.

**The Scope of System Editing**

**Connectivity**

All objects that are connected to the selected object are candidates for inclusion in the propagation (System Editing) process.

**Rules**

The consistency criteria specified in rules define which properties are propagated and in which direction.

The propagations scope can be expanded across a relationship if there is an applicable rule for the property being modified.

**Inconsistencies**

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The propagation scope is not expanded past an existing inconsistency for the property being modified.

Using **System Editing** does not resolve inconsistencies. You must resolve the inconsistency.

**Breaks (Break Labels)**

Propagation breaks can be defined for specified properties at specified relationships in a design. The propagation scope is not expanded past a break for the property being modified.

**Break Components**

Components can be defined with an option to break the nominal diameter or with a filter defining other specified properties that will break at that item. The propagation scope is not expanded past a break component for the property being modified.

**Access Control**

When working in a project, the propagation scope only includes objects that have been claimed.

**Highlighting**

All items that will be changed when a user is ready to change a certain property (clicking in a particular property field in the **Properties** window or picking a solution in the **Consistency Check Solutions** list) will be highlighted so that the user can see the scope of the items for which the particular property will be changed. This scope can vary according to the particular property being modified.

When making a graphical selection of a pipe route, initially only the connector piece of a pipe run is highlighted. However, because the data is stored by pipe run, even if system editing is switched off, the entire pipe run will have its data changed. To see how far a particular pipe run extends, you can turn system editing off and select in the **Properties** window on any property of that pipe run. The software will then highlight the entire pipe run.

**System Editing and Consistency Checking**

You can effectively propagate a changed property value across drawing boundaries. If a changed property value is propagated and it reaches an OPC, it simply stops at that point. An inconsistency indicator at the OPC shows that the value in the active drawing is inconsistent with the value on the connected pipe in the continuation drawing. To resolve this type of inconsistency, the user must open the continuation drawing.

With the continuation drawing open, the user can double-click on the inconsistency indicator to display the **Consistency Check** dialog. One of the solutions available for resolving inconsistencies is to copy the property value from the first drawing into the active drawing. When this solution is used, the property value from the pipe run in the first drawing is copied to the pipe run in the active drawing and spreads outward from there according to the standard propagation rules. Thus, property values can be propagated across document boundaries.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, placement is not allowed; therefore this information refers to the behavior of items that were placed by a Smart P&ID user.

**Inconsistencies**

System Editing never expands across an inconsistency for the property being propagated. For a given set of connected items with a consistent property value, System Editing allows you to easily change that value to a new value. However, if the items are not consistent to begin with (inconsistencies exist), then System Editing will not automatically make them consistent. Other tools are available (such as **Solutions** on the **Consistency Check** dialog) for resolving inconsistencies.

**Break Components**

Some components inherently limit the copying and suppress the consistency checking of certain properties.

For example, a reducer is a break component for the Nominal Diameter property. When changing the Nominal Diameter in a pipeline, the spread of that change is limited by any reducers that exist in that pipeline. The consistency checking that would normally be done between the connected pipes is also suppressed at the reducer.

A break component can be created for any property or collection of properties of a pipe run. To create a break component, you must first create a special filter. This filter must apply to pipe runs and must include the properties to be broken as criteria in the filter. The value for each property in the filter is not important.

Then, you have to open the symbol in **Catalog Manager** and select the **Property Breaks** command to select the filter.

When using a nozzle as a break component, the properties to be broken need to be added to the Piping Point item type in Data Dictionary Manager. Also, the ‘Process Pipe Run To Nozzle’ rule in Rule Manager (under **Plant Rules** > **Relationship** > **Piping**) needs to be modified by adding the required properties for Piping Point 1 of the nozzle to the consistency checks.

For more details, see under the section Creating Property Breaks in Catalog Manager Help. **Break Labels** The consistency criteria specified in the rules define the general behavior of the properties. Break labels provide a way to define exceptions to the general rules. A break label provides a visible and plottable symbol that signifies the end of one property value condition and the beginning of a new condition along a pipe. A changed property value is never propagated across a break label for that property. A break label also suppresses consistency checking for the property it breaks.

A break label can be created for any property or collection of properties of a pipe run. A break label is created in the **Catalog Manager** just like any other label, except that the **Label Type** property is set to **Attribute Break**. A SmartText field must be created for each property that is to be broken. In many cases the graphical shape of the label indicates which properties are broken. In these cases the Visible flag on the SmartText is set to False so that the text is not visible. It is also normal to turn the leader line on within the Catalog Manager so that it is automatically displayed at placement time. All of the symbols under Piping\Segment Breaks in the delivered catalog are break labels.

**System Editing and Projects**

When working in a project, the system enforces the rule that unclaimed objects cannot be modified. If you select an unclaimed object, the **Properties** window does not allow you to enter new values for its properties. Similarly, System Editing does not allow property values to flow to unclaimed objects.

If you have a claimed object that is connected to some unclaimed objects, and if you change a property on the claimed object, propagation will not change the property value on the unclaimed objects. The items in the propagation scope are initially collected using the standard propagation rules. However, all unclaimed items are removed from the propagation scope before any property values are changed.

Items that are claimed for relationship are treated as unclaimed for the purpose of propagation.

**System Editing Command (Tools Menu)**

When System Editing is enabled for a plant, changed property values are automatically spread or propagated to related items according to the currently defined consistency criteria. In certain cases, you might want to set a property value on one item only and not allow it to be propagated to any related items.

The **System Editing** command (on the **Tools** menu and the toolbar) allows you to turn off the propagation functionality temporarily during a design session. After the change has been made, you can use this same command to turn it back on again. System Editing is always turned on when you start a new design session.

System Editing can be enabled or disabled for the entire plant by means of the **Enable System Editing** setting that is exposed through Options Manager. For new plants, the value of this setting is True by default.

For upgraded plants, the value of this setting is False. This allows you to enable System Editing for an upgraded plant at the time of your choosing.

**Enable System Editing**

Select **Tools** > **System Editing** or select .

System Editing can be turned on or off for an entire plant for as long as needed or for a single design session.

**Apply Display Set Dialog**

Specifies which symbols display in the Drawing View. Select **View > Apply Display Set** to open this dialog.

Display sets use filters that control which symbols you want to display. You can save these filters and share them with other users working in the same Plant. If a display set is currently active, its name displays in the lower right-hand corner of the product.

Display sets can be created manually or automatically. For the manually created display sets, you can define filters, colors and widths for the display items. For automatic display sets, filters are created automatically with colors and widths already defined, that you can modify as required.

The automatically created display sets are shown in the **AutoDisplaySet** folder that appears under the plant’s folder. See Working with Auto Display Sets.

To remove the results displayed by selecting the **Apply Display Set** command, select **View** > **Clear** **Display Set**.

**Add Folder**

**Working with Assemblies**

An assembly is a group of items that you can place in a drawing at one time. Assemblies can save time because you do not have to keep creating commonly-occurring groups of items. Instead of copying and pasting each individual item into a drawing at several locations, you can place the group of items: the assembly. An example of an assembly is a control valve with vents on both sides, an instrument loop that controls the valve, and a piping bypass around the valve.

You can create an assembly by selecting several items in a drawing and saving as an assembly. The file extension for an assembly is .pid, which is the same file extension as a drawing. If you want to retrieve the assembly from the **Catalog Explorer** tree view, you must save the assembly where the other symbols are located. The **Save as Assembly** command prompts you to save the assembly in the correct directory, which is specified in Options Manager.

Placing assemblies is like placing any other item from **Catalog Explorer** into a drawing. When you want to place an assembly into a drawing, you select the assembly from **Catalog Explorer** and select a location in the drawing. Or, you can drag the assembly into the drawing. The information in each label remains intact when you place the assembly. After you have placed an assembly, the items in the assembly are treated as separate items. You can delete just one item without concern that the software deletes the entire assembly.

Assemblies cannot be placed inline. You must place the assembly first and then route piping to it, if required.

Assemblies can be created in one plant and used in another. However, the file structure and symbols must be identical. If you try to place an assembly into a plant that uses a different file structure, you get an error message that the software cannot find your reference files. The assembly placement quits.

Move the symbols that cannot be found to the location indicated in the error message.

When creating or placing assemblies, a log file is created for each action. The log files are placed in the Temp directory and are named _CreAsm.log and _PlaAsm.log.

The following is an example of the log file created when creating assemblies.

Source Drawing Name: \\sppid-

1. Use the red target that appears at the end of your pointer to specify the origin of the assembly for placement.

You can only use a standalone symbol as the origin of an assembly. For example, you cannot use labels, pipe runs, signal runs, or child items; however, you can use unattached ends of pipe runs.

1. On the **Save as Assembly** dialog, enter the file name.
2. Select **Save**.

Any graphics that have been band-aided should be deleted and replaced prior to using this command.

The file extension for assemblies is .pid.

You can save an assembly in any directory that you want, but the default assembly path is specified in Options Manager. If you use the default folder, then you can retrieve the assembly from **Catalog** **Explorer**. In order to save assemblies, you must have write permissions to the folder defined in Options Manager.

Assemblies can be created in one plant and used in another. However, the file structure and symbols must be identical. If you try to place an assembly into a plant that uses a different file structure, you get an error message that the software cannot find your reference files. The assembly placement quits. Move the symbols that cannot be found to the location indicated in the error message.

Using Projects in an Existing Workshare Collaboration.

To implement off-site projects in Smart P&ID, you use standalone workshare functionality. See

Working with Off-Site Projects.

**Projects vs. Workshare**

The following comparisons can be useful when making the decision about whether to use projects or Workshare or both.

**Using Projects in an Existing Workshare Collaboration**

You must discontinue all Workshare collaboration in a plant before you can create projects in the plant. In other words, if the plant structure contains active **Satellites**, the **Enable Projects** command remains unavailable. We recommend completing the following tasks before enabling the plant for projects.

1. Transfer all drawings to the host.
2. Delete all satellites.
3. Disable the plant for Workshare.
4. Enable the plant for projects.

1. Create a project to serve as the host.
2. Enable the project for Workshare.
3. Create satellite slots in the project host.
4. Create satellites.
5. Check out or fetch drawings at the host, then re-distribute drawings back out to the satellites.

**Working with Off-Site Projects**

To implement off-site projects in Smart P&ID, you use standalone workshare functionality. See the following help topics:

**Working with Smart P&ID Projects**

Plants, after designed and built, are often modified throughout their lifecycles. During these modifications, information assets of the “As-Built” state must be maintained. Using projects in your plant allows you to maintain this information while allowing multiple projects, possibly overlapping and running concurrently, to be designed, approved, constructed, and/or canceled.

Before creating a project in a plant, you must enable that plant for projects. When enabled for projects, the plant structure becomes the Plant, sometimes referred to as the Master or As-Built plant. In a Task/Master scenario, the Plant is the Master and the projects are the individual Tasks.

**Database Configuration**

To allow work on projects to proceed without affecting the Plant, separate schemas are created for each project. In other words, all projects must be located in the same database instance as the Plant, with each project contained within a separate schema (separate database user names).

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 212/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The Plant shares reference data with its projects. Changes to the reference data can be made only in the Plant. In other words, you can use Catalog Manager, Data Dictionary Manager, Filter Manager, and Format Manager in a project, but you have read-only permissions and are not allowed to modify any of the data from within these managers.

**Fetching and Checking Out Drawings**

After projects are enabled in Smart Engineering Manager, the As-Built can no longer create drawings; drawings are created inside projects. However, any drawings that might have existed in the plant before projects were enabled remain in the As-Built. All drawing versions in the As-Built are read-only drawings when projects are enabled, but these drawings can still be deleted in the As-Built, unless the drawing is either fetched or checked out to a project. If the plant is registered in SmartPlant Foundation, drawings can be created and edited in the As-Built, except for drawings that are checked out to a project.

**Projects and Claiming**

One of the main capabilities associated with using projects in an integrated environment is the ability for a project to *claim* a drawing object. When a project claims an object, the project controls modifications to that object. A project cannot modify objects it has not claimed. All the modifications and claiming of objects is carried out in the design software, but the claim states of objects inside drawings do have ramifications for drawing manipulation and for completing projects. You do not need to check out a drawing to claim items on it; you can claim items on a fetched drawing.

Projects claim objects in either Exclusive (default) or Shared mode. If you plan to use the project in an integrated environment, Exclusive mode is mandatory. Use the **Settings** view in Options Manager to set the Claim Mode before creating a project.

When publishing from a project, an instruction container, which contains all the claimed objects, is created within the tombstone file.

You can change the Claim Mode to Shared at any time. However, you can change the mode to Exclusive only when there are no claims in any project in the Plant.

**Using Workshare with Projects**

Workshare functions the same whether using projects or not. The only difference is that when using projects, only a project can function as a Workshare host. The Plant cannot be a host or a satellite when projects are enabled.

**Working with Drawings within a Project**

After enabling and creating projects in Smart Engineering Manager for Smart P&ID, use Drawing Manager to manipulate the drawings. Actual design work is still accomplished in Smart P&ID; however, managing and https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 213/573

setting out that work is largely controlled from the Drawing Manager interface. Only the project can use the commands on the **Project** menu in Drawing Manager to fetch, check in, and check out drawings.

After projects are enabled in Smart Engineering Manager, the As-Built can no longer create drawings; drawings are created inside projects. However, any drawings that might have existed in the plant before projects were enabled remain in the As-Built. All drawing versions in the As-Built are read-only drawings when projects are enabled, but these drawings can still be deleted in the As-Built, unless the drawing is either fetched or checked out to a project. If the plant is registered in SmartPlant Foundation, drawings can be created and edited in the As-Built, except for drawings that are checked out to a project.

When you are using projects inside Smart P&ID, remember that the reference data belongs to the Plant and is used by projects of the As-Built. You cannot change reference data, such as table layouts or formats or rules, at the project level.

**Claiming**

Claiming Items on a drawing is one of the main features of using projects in an integrated environment.

When a project claims an object on a drawing, the project controls modifications to that object. A project cannot modify objects that it has not claimed.

Projects claim objects in either Exclusive (default) or Shared claim mode. If you plan to use the project in an integrated environment, Exclusive mode is mandatory. Use the **Settings** view in Options Manager to set the **Claim Mode** value before creating a project.

You can change the claim mode to Shared at any time. However, you can change the claim mode to Exclusive only when there are no claims in any project in the Plant.

All the modifications and claiming of objects is carried out in the design software, but the claim states of objects inside drawings do have ramifications for drawing manipulation and for completing projects. You do not need to check out a drawing to claim items on it; you can claim items on a fetched drawing.

**Smart P&ID Project Statuses**

You can review the status of the active project using the **Project Status** command in Drawing Manager. The **Project Status** dialog shows the status of the active project and tells you where the project is in its lifecycle.

See Modify Project Status in Smart P&ID.

A **project** status shows the stage of the project life-cycle. Possible project statuses are: **Active**

The initial state of a project right after its creation.

**Completed**

Indicates that all the work on the project items has been completed and that the items are ready to be merged back into the As-Built. You cannot claim items in a project whose status has been set to **Completed** https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 214/573

or **Merged**.

In a project, when searching for completed items in the **Project Management** window, it is possible to select the related items which have not been completed yet and to change their status to **Completed**.

**Merged**

Indicates that all the project items have been merged back into the As-Built.

**Canceled**

Indicates that the project has been canceled and it can be deleted. Selecting this project status changes the status of the items in the project from **Claimed** to **Scoped**.

**Project Status Command (Project Menu)**

Opens the **Project Status** dialog, which allows you to update, modify, and verify the status of your project with respect to the Plant and/or SmartPlant Foundation. Possible statuses include **Active**, **Completed**, **Merged**, and **Canceled**. This command is not available if you are currently in the Plant; it is only available if your current database is a project database.

After a project enters the **Completed** state, all the commands are disabled and design work is no longer possible within that project. If you later determine that the project is really not done, use the **Return to** **Active** button on the **Project Status** dialog. This command resets the project status to **Active**, allowing work to continue in the project. This command is only enabled when the project is in the **Completed** state.

**Project Status Dialog**

Displays the current project status, both with respect to SmartPlant Foundation and the plant and allows you to update or modify those statuses. This dialog opens when you select **Project** > **Project Status** on the main menu bar.

**Fetching a Drawing to an Active Project**

Fetching a drawing from the Plant places a copy of the drawing in the project. Only one project at a time can check out a drawing, but numerous projects can *fetch* the same drawing.

Fetched drawings can have read-only or read/write permissions. If you want to save changes to a read/write fetched drawing into the Plant, you must check the drawing out first, apply your changes, and then check it back into the Plant.

If you are working with projects but are not connected to SmartPlant Foundation, all claims on items in that drawing are automatically released when you delete a fetched drawing from your project database.

A Workshare satellite can only fetch drawing versions from its own database by using the **Fetch** command in the **Version History** dialog. If you want a drawing version from another project or the Plant, it must be fetched into the host project and then the satellite can use the **Get Latest Version** commands on the **Workshare** menu.

**Fetch Command (Project Menu)**

Displays the **Fetch** dialog, which provides options for fetching a drawing version from the Plant or another project. You can fetch a drawing with read/write permissions or with read-only permissions.

The **Fetch** command is not available if you are currently working in the Plant. You cannot fetch a deleted drawing, but a deleted drawing can be retrieved if a version of it is saved, and then you can fetch it.

**Fetch Dialog**

Displays the active Plant hierarchy and lists its drawings, allowing you to fetch a drawing from a specified database. This dialog appears when you select **Project** > **Fetch** or the **Fetch**  command.

You can open a read-only version of the drawing for review by selecting **View**. For more information about viewing drawing versions without fetching or checking them out, see Show the Version History of a Drawing.

If you are connected to SmartPlant Foundation and you have already fetched the drawing with read/write permissions when you check the drawing out, the fetched version remains intact and only its status changes to checked-out. That is, you cannot replace the fetched version with the version in the Plant.

**Checking a Drawing Out to an Active Project**

Checking out a drawing places that drawing under the control of the project. No other project can check out the same drawing while your project has it checked out. The advantage of checking out rather than fetching a drawing is that only checked out drawings can have their changes reflected back in the Plant.

The software notifies you if you try to fetch a version of a drawing that you have already checked out.

When working with projects in an integrated environment, you must select **No** for the **Enable**

**“Keep Checked Out” on Check-In** option in Options Manager.

After you check out a drawing to a project, the drawing will be read only in the As-Built and the following actions are not allowed:

Modifying drawing properties

Modifying the drawing or any drawing items or properties

Deleting the drawing

Updating the drawing using Drawing Manager

Updating the drawing using automation

You cannot check out a drawing to a project if it is open in the As-Built.

The software cannot validate a drawing in the As-Built using the Global Validation functionality if you have checked out that drawing to a project.

**Check Out Command (Project Menu)**

Displays the **Check Out** dialog, allowing you to check drawings out from the Plant and into your current project. This command checks user permissions, assigned in Smart Engineering Manager, before it allows you to check out a drawing.

You can check out drawings that you have already fetched to your project, too. The **Check Out** command is available only inside a project of the Plant; that is, you cannot check a drawing out from a project and into the Plant. After a drawing is checked out to a project, the drawing icon changes to reflect the new status.

commands that apply only to that view.

You can select an item in either **Drawing** view. The item is then located in the appropriate group in the **Change details** list. If you select an item in the **Change details** list, then you can use the **Find in** **Drawings** button on the toolbar to locate the item in one or both **Drawing** views.

You can select an item in the **Drawing** view or in the **Change details** list. Properties for that item appear in the **Properties** window. Selecting multiple items is not possible on the **Compare** dialog.

The following differences are ignored: claim status, select list strings, linked or embedded objects, symbology, and inconsistency indicators.

You can only compare a drawing against a version of itself; that is, you cannot compare one drawing to another drawing.

You can also compare versions when you are checking in a drawing. See Check In a Drawing.

If you attempt to compare two versions that are actually identical to each other, the **Compare** dialog does not open and a confirmation message alerts you as to why.

**Returning a Drawing to the Plant Using Check In**

Checking in a drawing writes all of the changes made to the drawing by the project into the drawing stored in the Plant. When a drawing is checked in, all versions of that drawing are deleted from the project.

**Verification Processes Performed During Check In**

All objects that exist in the project but don’t exist in the Plant must be claimed.

All objects that exist in the Plant but don’t exist in the project (they were deleted) must have been claimed.

All objects that exist in both the Plant and the project must be identical if not claimed.

The claim state must be valid for the project.

If any claim on an object on this drawing is invalid, then check in cannot occur.

The timestamp on all objects that exist in the project must be earlier than or equal to the timestamp on the drawing.

Last Publish Date > Drawing date.

Check in is not allowed if drawing is in a **Re-create** state.

The **Verify for Checkin** command for new drawings should ensure that all items on the drawing have been claimed.

If an invalid claim is found but the item in question matches the item in the Plant, run **Verify for** **Checkin** to resolve this situation. This process automatically sets the claim to valid and allows the check in to occur.

**Check In Command (Project Menu)**

Enables you to check drawings into the Plant. This command is available only when drawings are selected in the **List** view and when those drawings are checked out to the current project. Drawings created in a project automatically belong to that project and can be selected and checked in. This command is not available from within the Plant.

You must have the correct permissions, assigned in Smart Engineering Manager, to check drawings in or out.

You cannot check a drawing in if any of the objects that belong to that drawing were modified after the latest version of a drawing was created. For more information about creating versions, see Save a Version of a Drawing.

If an invalid claim is found but the item in question matches the item in the Plant, run **Verify for** **Checkin** to resolve this situation. This process automatically sets the claim to valid and allows the check in to occur.

You cannot check in a fetched drawing. In order to check a drawing in, it must be checked out. For

more information about checking out drawings, see Check Out a Drawing.

If your current active database is the Plant database, you cannot check in drawings. See *Connect to a* *Database* in the *Smart P&ID Drawing Manager Help*.

When you check a drawing into the Plant, any claims on objects on that drawing are automatically released. See Claiming Items.

When you check a drawing into the Plant, your version of the drawing becomes the current version in the Plant. However, the version that was in the Plant already is automatically saved as the previous version.

You can select a checked out drawing and use the **Verify for Checkin** command to make sure claims

and conflicts are resolved before you try to check in a drawing. See Verify a Drawing for Checkin.

If an invalid claim is found but the item in question matches the item in the Plant, run **Verify for** **Checkin** to resolve this situation. This process automatically sets the claim to valid and allows the check in to occur.

After verifying the drawing for checkin, check the drawing into the Plant as soon as possible because the verification process does not freeze the drawing state and the changes can be made to the

drawing during any interim time between verification and actual check in. See Check In a Drawing.

You cannot check in a fetched drawing, it must be checked out first. You can, however, check in a new drawing created in the project. See Check Out a Drawing.

Verifying a drawing for checkin checks exactly the same drawing conditions as the **Check In** command, but without actually checking the drawing into the Plant.

If an invalid claim is found but the item in question matches the item in the Plant, run **Verify for** **Checkin** to resolve this situation. This process automatically sets the claim to valid and allows the check in to occur.

**Editing Drawing Items Within a Project**

New items can be created in a project drawing using Smart P&ID Engineering. As these items are added to the drawing, they are automatically claimed by the project. If your edits to an item cause related items to be modified, those related items must be claimed also. Moving items and adding labels, for example, can be accomplished without claiming.

When an existing drawing is fetched or checked out to a project, none of the items are claimed. You will not be able to modify or delete any items until they are claimed. Use the **Claim** command to define the scope for your project. Claim modes include Exclusive and Shared. Exclusive mode allows only a single project to claim an item. Using Shared mode, multiple projects can claim the same item at the same time.

You can compare your current drawing with a previous version to locate any differences. These differences display as change groups. The change group contains a list of changes that can be made in the current drawing and still maintain consistency. You can then choose to accept the changes, if needed. Each change group is marked if it affects items you have claimed. You should accept, or refresh, all of the changes that do not involve items claimed by you because these items represent changes checked in by other projects.

See Comparing and Refreshing Versions

Items must be claimed before you can delete them. If deleting an item results in changes to related items, then those related items must be claimed also.

**Claiming Items**

A project in the Plant frequently deals with a subset of items within a drawing. The Claim functionality provided by Smart P&ID Engineering allows you to grant control of an item to a project. Because claiming makes it possible for a project to work on an item-by-item basis, claiming fosters an ability to define the scope of work as narrowly as necessary.

A new item is created in a project in the same ways it can be created in a greenfield plant (not applicable for Smart P&ID Engineering Engineering). The simplest way to create a new item is to drag a catalog item from the Catalog Explorer** **and drop it onto a drawing. A new item in a drawing is automatically claimed to the project.

However, when an existing drawing is fetched or checked out to a project, none of the items on that drawing are initially claimed. Before you can modify any of those items, you must claim them.

After you have claimed an item, you can modify it using the same methods that you would use in a plant that is not project enabled. Purely graphical modifications to drawing items are allowed without claiming those items (not applicable for Smart P&ID Engineering Engineering). For example, a symbol can be repositioned or the vertices of a connector can be moved. Also, labels can be added or removed without claiming anything.

Any modification that changes the meaning of the schematic design (not applicable for Smart P&ID

Engineering Engineering), however, requires that the affected items be claimed. For example, if you break a pipe run, some of the piping components and inline instruments in that pipe run will be reassigned to the https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 237/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

new pipe run. Therefore, the pipe run, the piping components and the instruments in that pipe run must all be claimed before you break it. If they are not claimed, an error message will be displayed.

Properties of items that are not claimed by the active project cannot be changed. In the Smart P&ID

Engineering modeler, the mirror and rotate handles are not available for any item you select that was not claimed by your project. The **Properties** window and the **Engineering Data Editor** do not allow editing of properties on items that are not claimed: the properties are read-only as if the drawing is in a read-only state. No other explicit prompts let you know that you cannot edit an item that you have not claimed.

However, you can manipulate the **Drawing** view properties so that the claim state of items is visually apparent.

System Editing does not allow property values to flow to unclaimed objects. If you have a claimed object that is connected to some unclaimed objects, and if you change a property on the claimed object, propagation will not change the property value on the unclaimed objects. The items in the propagation scope are initially collected using the standard propagation rules. However, all unclaimed items are removed from the propagation scope before any property values are changed.

Items that are claimed for relationship are treated as unclaimed for the purpose of propagation.

You cannot delete items that have not been claimed (not applicable for Smart P&ID Engineering Engineering). After you have claimed an item, you can delete it using the same methods that you would use in a greenfield plant. However, if the deletion of an item would result in related items being deleted or modified, then those related items must also be claimed. For example, if you delete a vessel, the nozzles attached to it will be deleted and the pipe runs connected to the nozzles will be modified. Therefore, the vessel, the nozzles and the pipe runs must all be claimed before you delete the vessel. If they are not claimed, an error message will be displayed.

You do not need to check out a drawing to claim objects; you can fetch a drawing with read/write permissions and claim its objects. Claim commands appear on shortcut menus in the **Drawing** view, in the **Engineering Data Editor**, and on the **Edit** menu.

**Releasing Claims**

From inside a project, you can invoke a claim at any time to expand the scope of your project, and any new item created in a project is automatically claimed by that project. You can also release a claim at any time, but you cannot release the claim that is automatically created when your project creates a new item.

Claims are automatically released on all drawing items when that drawing is checked into the Plant; however, a drawing cannot be checked in if any objects that are *not* claimed differ from the Plant.

**Claim Mode**

The claim mode can be set to either **Exclusive** or **Shared** by using the **Settings** option in Smart P&ID

Options Manager. The claim mode controls how items are claimed by concurrent projects.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 238/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

If the claim mode is set to **Exclusive**, only one project can claim an item at any given time. Exclusive mode enforces the rule that concurrent projects do not overlap at the object level. With this setting, conflict resolution at check in time is simplified.

If the claim mode is set to **Shared**, a single item can be claimed to more than one project. Shared mode allows concurrent projects to overlap at the object level. This setting might be required for plants that have overlapping projects. Conflict resolution at check in time will be more complex.

**Invalid Claims**

When an item is claimed by a project, it must be consistent with the state of the item in the Plant. Otherwise, an invalid claim exists. Invalid claiming can happen only for Plants that support shared claiming of database items. Invalidly claimed items differ from the Plant items in that you cannot check in a drawing to the Plant without first establishing a valid claim on items that have been modified.

When the Plant uses Shared claim mode and a project checks in a drawing, the claims made by other projects to objects on that same drawing are now invalid if the project that checked in the drawing also changed an item claimed by a different project.

You can determine the validity of a claim by using the **Claim Status** command.

If an invalid claim is found but the item in question matches the item in the Plant, run **Verify for Check In** to resolve the situation. This process automatically sets the claim to valid and allows the check in to occur.

**Partial Claim**

When a claimed item has a relationship with another item that has not been claimed, any change made to the claimed item that also changes the relationship, causes the non-claimed item to receive Partial Claim status, denoted by . Partial Claim status only applies to objects connected to pipe runs (inline components such as instrumentation and piping components).

Partial claim works automatically when a claimed pipe run is ‘broken’. There is a routine that determines which side of the broken pipe run gets the new GUID and which side maintains the original GUID. Inline components on the side that gets the new GUID receive Partial Claim status, which is only for the purpose of changing their database relationship to the pipe run with new GUID. Data cannot be edited on items that are ‘claimed for relationship purposes’.

A list of claimed items is automatically published to SmartPlant.

Claim commands are not available when you open a fetched drawing with read-only permissions.

Claiming of labels is ignored.

Drawing Manager is the only tool for checking in, checking out, and fetching drawings.

You must have full control user access permissions for P&ID objects before you can claim objects.

See *Smart Engineering Manager*  Help.

Objects are claimed by the *project*, not by a single user. After a project claims an item, it can be modified by anyone with the appropriate permissions in that project.

In Exclusive claim mode, the software allows the user to claim all the selected items that were not already claimed by other projects. The claim log shows which items could not be claimed because they were already claimed by other projects.

Claiming items clears the Undo stack. Thus, claiming is not a command that can be undone.

**Claim Command**

Gives control of the selected items to the current active project. The Claim Dialog opens, allowing you to confirm the “claim-ability” of the items and enter claim comments. Claim comments can be viewed later by anyone in the Plant when the claim status is displayed.

This command can only be used for items that belong to the active drawing.

**Claim Dialog**

Opens when you select an item and select **Edit** > Claim on the main menu bar and displays details of the items that you select for claiming. You can discover if the selected items are already claimed by your project or another project. The **Claim** command checks first if your project already has a valid claim on a selected item. Next it checks if the items are claimed by another project, and if the Plant uses exclusive sharing, this step can produce an error display on the **Claim** dialog. Finally the command compares the selected items against the same items in the Plant and displays a warning if an object either differs from that item in the Plant or if the object does not exist in the Plant.

**Items to be claimed**

Lists the items that are selected in the Drawing view or **Engineering Data Editor** and their details. These are the items that you claim to your project when you select **OK**. You can select multiple elements of this list and record comments for this claim operation. In this list, you can also see if a selected item is already claimed or has any other claim errors or warnings associated with it.

**Comments**

Allows you to record comments for the claim operation that you are currently undertaking.

**Claim a Drawing Item**

1. In the **Drawing** view or **Engineering Data Editor**, select the items that you want to claim.
2. Select **Edit** > **Claim** to display the **Claim** dialog.

1. Record comments about this claim operation. In the **Items to be claimed** list, fill in the **Comments** box. The comments will be applied to all the items in the **Items to be claimed** list.

A newly placed item is automatically claimed by the project that placed it (not applicable for Smart P&ID Engineering Engineering).

Remember that objects are claimed by the *project*, not by a single user. After a project claims an item, it can be modified by anyone with the appropriate permissions in that project.

In Exclusive claim mode, the software allows the user to claim all the selected items that were not already claimed by other projects. The claim log shows which items could not be claimed because they were already claimed by other projects.

Claiming items clears the Undo stack. Thus, claiming is not an undoable command.

You can only claim an item in the **Engineering Data Editor** if that item belongs to the active drawing.

**Enforcing Claims**

Whether you are using shared or exclusive claiming mode, claiming objects to your project involves many special relationships. The following topics discuss some of the ways that claiming restricts your activities.

The claim mode (Exclusive or Shared) is defined in Options Manager for the Plant and all its projects. When you claim an item, it is claimed to your active project. No items are ever claimed by the Plant.

**Controlling Access**

Each command in the software checks your permissions for the items that it modifies. When possible, commands simply do not allow the operation to proceed if you do not have the necessary permissions. In cases where the software cannot prevent you from initiating a command, an error message is displayed.

You must have full control permissions on P&ID Objects before you can claim any drawing items. See User Access in *Smart Engineering Manager Help*.

**Modifying Properties**

Claiming impacts properties modifications in the following manner.

**Properties Window**

When you select a claimed item, the **Properties** window allows the properties of that item to be viewed and modified. When you select an item that has not been claimed, the **Properties** window allows the properties to be viewed but not modified. The properties of unclaimed items are read-only.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 241/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

When you select a line segment, the **Properties** window displays the properties of the associated pipe or signal run. If the run has been claimed, the properties can be edited; otherwise, the properties are read-only.

When you select multiple items, if they are all claimed, the **Properties** window allows them to be modified. If any of the selected items are not claimed, the **Properties** window treats the whole group as read-only.

**Engineering Data Editor (EDE)**

If the item has been claimed, you can edit its properties through the EDE; otherwise, the EDE treats the item properties as read-only. The EDE behaves similarly to the **Properties** window.

**Consistency Check Dialog**

The **Solutions** section of the **Consistency Check** dialog allows you to copy property values from one item to another. For the selected solution, if the destination item is not claimed, the **Apply** button is not available.

**Implied Items**

When a drawing item is claimed, it means that you can modify that model item and all of its implied items. If a model item is not claimed, the user cannot modify any of the implied items that the model item owns.

**Placement Rules**

When a new relationship is created, such as when you place a nozzle on a vessel, the applicable rules copy property values across the relationship. When a relationship to an unclaimed item is created, properties can be copied *from* that item without any problem; however, if the rule calls for properties to be copied *to* an unclaimed item, the action is not allowed, and the properties are not copied. An inconsistency indicator shows the inconsistency between the two related items.

**Placing and Moving Drawing Items**

Sometimes the target item must be claimed, but other times it does not have to be claimed. The following list explains how the relationship between an object and its target effects claiming.

**Placing Nozzles**, **Equipment Components**, **Room Components**, or **Instrument Components**: The target item does not need to be claimed.

**Placing Piping Components or Instruments in Pipe or Signal Runs**: The target run must be claimed. In certain cases, placing a piping component or inline instrument causes a zero-length line segment to be created and automatic line connectivity causes it to be joined to an existing run. The target of that zero-length line must be claimed.

**Placing Reducers**: A reducer is a “line-breaking component”. The target pipe run and all of its components must be claimed.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 242/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

**Placing Flow-Oriented Components**: A flow-oriented component sets the flow direction of the target process run, if it is not already set. The target process run must be claimed. You can place a flow arrow label, however, if the flow direction is already defined.

**Placing OPCs on Runs**: The target connector must be claimed.

If the target item needs to be claimed but is not claimed, then you cannot place your item onto the target; the target will not highlight, and your item will not “snap” into position. If no type of placement is allowed at that point, the “no place” indicator

is displayed. In most cases, freestanding placement is still allowed.

**Geometric Modifications**

Geometric operations include a geometric move, with the ALT key pressed where necessary, a rotation, a mirroring, and a scale or parametric modification. The selected symbol does not have to be claimed to perform these operations. None of the connected items have to be claimed either.

**Rotation and Mirroring of Inline Components**

Rotations of 180 degrees and mirroring about the local y-axis for inline components are special geometric modifications cases because the lines are disconnected before and reconnected after the operations.

Therefore, the lines, but not the selected symbol, must be claimed before these operations are allowed. If the lines are not claimed, the standard claim violation message displays.

**Rule-Based Moves**

All connected items must be claimed, as described above. If the required connected items are not all claimed, the move operation can become a geometric move, as if you pressed the ALT key.

**Placing and Modifying Lines**

Sometimes the target item must be claimed, sometimes not. Here is a list of the cases where claiming plays a role:

**Routing Lines up to Nozzles**:The nozzles do not have to be claimed.

**Routing Lines up to Freestanding Piping Components or Instruments**: The piping component or instrument must be claimed because it will be adopted by the new run.

**Routing Lines up to Owned Piping Components or Instruments**: The piping component or instrument does not have to be claimed. In certain cases, when routing a line segment up to an existing inline component, automatic line connectivity will cause an existing zero length run to be joined to the new run. The target run must be claimed.

**Routing Lines up to OPCs:** The OPC does not have to be claimed.

**Routing Lines up to Another Pipe or Signal Run:** The target run must be claimed.

If the target item needs to be claimed but is not claimed, you are not allowed to connect to the target. The black connection handle does not appear at the required point.

**Geometric Modification**

If you move a line segment or a line vertex that is internal to a line, then the piping or signal run that owns the selected segment does not have to be claimed.

**Extreme End of a Run**

If you modify the start point of the first line segment in a run or the end point of the last line segment in a run, then the following stipulations apply:

1. The selected run must be claimed.
2. The target item might need to be claimed.
3. If the existing connected item is a branch point for the run, then the run it belongs to must be claimed because the branch point is deleted and the adjacent line segments in the existing connected run are merged.
4. If a component is connected to the endpoint, it does not need to be claimed.

**Internal Vertex of a Run**

Modification of an internal vertex can result in the run being split; consequently, the following stipulations apply:

1. The entire run and all components must be claimed.
2. The target item might need to be claimed.

**Breaking and Joining Runs**

The **Break Run** command allows you to split one piping or signal run into two pieces. The run to be broken and all components within that run must be claimed.

The **Join Runs** command allows you to combine two connected piping or signal runs into a single run. Both of the runs and all components in both runs must be claimed.

**Placing and Modifying Labels**

The target item for a label usually does not need to be claimed. However, claiming plays a role in the following cases:

**Placing Driving Labels**

A driving label sets one or more properties on the labeled item. The target item must be claimed. This includes flow arrow labels, unless the flow direction is already defined for the process run.

**Placing Labels on Area Breaks**

Placing a label on an area break causes a dynamic property to be added to the area break. For this to happen, the area break must be claimed.

If you modify a label, you do not need to claim it. However, modifying a driving label modifies the labeled item. Therefore, you must claim the item.

Deleting a driving label nulls the value on the related object.

**Place Multiple Representations Command**

This **Stockpile** command enables you to place an additional representation of an existing equipment item into the design in a different drawing, thus creating a multiple representation in the database. You must claim the selected equipment item before this command is made available on the **Stockpile** menu in the EDE.

**Placing and Modifying Area Breaks**

The placement of an area break does not create any new relationships and therefore does not require any claiming. Modifying an area break allows the shape to be changed. This is a purely geometric modification, and so no claiming is required.

**Placing Gaps**

Placing a gap symbol into a piping or signal line implies that the target line must be claimed. If the target line run is not claimed, it is not highlighted as a valid target when you move the pointer over it.

**Replacing Drawing Items**

The **Replace** and **Replace Mode** commands replace one item representation in the design with a different representation and change the value of the “type” attribute for the design item. To replace an item using these commands, you must claim that item.

**Replace Mode**

The claim status check takes place as you move the pointer over the target. If the target is not claimed, the target is not highlighted as a valid replacement target.

**Find and Replace**

Items that are not claimed can be found, but they cannot be replaced. The **Replace** button is not available if an unclaimed item is selected.

**Deleting Items**

Claiming impacts item deletion in the following manner.

**Drawing Items**

Drawing items are deleted from a design using a number of different commands: **Delete to Stockpile** > **Plant**, **Delete to Stockpile** > **Drawing**, **Delete from Model**, and **Cut**. When implementing these commands, all dependent items must be claimed. That is, all items that are to be deleted along with a selected item must be claimed. Any lines attached to or dependent on selected items must be claimed. If any attached or dependent items are not claimed, an error message appears if you attempt to delete them.

It is not permitted to delete an item that has an invalid claim status. If you attempt to delete one or more items on a drawing that have invalid claims, the deletion will fail for those items and an error message will be displayed. The SP_ID and Item Tag for those items will be logged in the Smart P&ID Engineering log file.

The following table lists dependent items which must be claimed, item type by item type.

**Item in Select Set**

**Additional items that must be claimed for Delete**

Instrument

All instrument components – actuators, functions, and so forth

All item notes

All runs with lines that attach to the instrument

OPC

All item notes

All runs with lines that attach to the OPC

The partner OPC must be claimed also

**Stockpile Items**

Most items in the stockpile do not have any relationships. For these items, if the item is claimed, it can be deleted from the stockpile. If the item is not claimed, the **Delete** command opens the standard claim violation message.

Plant item groups, for example loops, packages, and so forth, exist in the stockpile and have relationships to member items on a drawing or in a stockpile. If the plant item group is claimed and all of its members are claimed, then the plant item group can be deleted. If the plant item group or any of its members is not claimed, the **Delete** command opens the standard claim violation message.

When an OPC is in the stockpile, it maintains its relationship to the partner OPC. OPCs can be deleted from the stockpile only if both OPCs in a pair are in the stockpile and are deleted at the same time. In a project context, both OPCs in a pair must be claimed before they can be deleted.

**Moving Between Stockpiles**

The Move to Different Stockpile command in the Engineering Data Editor allows you to move an item from one stockpile to a different stockpile. The selected model item must be claimed before you can use this command (if you are using a Project).

**Validating Properties**

The software uses validation functions before setting properties on items. The software checks the claim status before setting any values. If the item is claimed, the property can be changed. If the item is not claimed, the property cannot be changed. For more information about validating properties, select **Start** > **Programs** > **Intergraph Smart P&ID Engineering Programming Help** and see the *Extending the* *Capabilities of Smart P&ID Engineering* and *Logical Model Automation Reference* topics.

You can use the validation and calculation functions on drawing item type. The software uses the same automation interface managing all other item types.

**To Do List and Correlating Items**

Claiming impacts the To Do List and other SmartPlant commands in the following manner.

**Create Task**

Running a Create task creates a new item in the stockpile. The new item is claimed automatically as soon as it is created.

**Update Task**

Running an Update task sets or changes some properties of an existing item. The item to be updated must be claimed before it can be updated. If it is not claimed, the task status is set to **Error** and a note is added to the **Notes** area on the **General** tab of the **Task Properties** dialog.

**Delete Task**

Running a Delete task causes the target item to be deleted. The item to be deleted and possibly other related items must be claimed before the task can do its work. If all of the necessary items are not claimed, the task status is set to **Error** and a note is added to the **Notes** area on the **General** tab of the **Task** **Properties** dialog.

**Correlate Item**

The **SmartPlant** > **Correlate** command correlates pipe runs to the same design basis as an existing pipe run that is already correlated. Properties are copied from the primary pipe run to the other pipe runs. You must claim the pipe runs to be modified. If they are not claimed, they cannot be correlated.

Creating or deleting tasks is not allowed in Smart P&ID Engineering Engineering.

**Reviewing a Claim Status**

Use the **Claim Status** command to see if an item has been claimed. This command displays a dialog that shows if the item is claimed by this project or by any other project and, if it is claimed, the date of the operation, the name of the user and any related comments.

Another way to see which items are claimed is with the **Show Claims** command, which paints the items on the drawing with different colors depending on whether the item has been claimed. The typical way to configure the colors is to show unclaimed items in a light gray color and claimed items with their normal symbology. With the **Show Claims** switch turned on, you can very quickly see what is claimed and what is not.

**Display the Claim Status of a Drawing Item**

1. In the Drawing view or **Engineering Data Editor**, select the items for which you want to display the claim status.
2. Select **Edit** > Claim Status to display the Claim Status Dialog.
3. Review the information in the list of items.
4. To claim the items to your project, select elements in the list and select **Claim**.
5. To relinquish claims on those items by your project, select elements in the list and select **Release** **Claim**.
6. To see more detailed information about the claim status of that item, the project that has claimed the item, the user who claimed it, and any related comments, select an element in the list and select **Details**.

**Claim Status Command**

Opens the Claim Status Dialog, which displays the details of the claimed state of the selected items and

enables you to claim items, release the claims to items, and so forth. You must select the items in the Drawing view or the **Engineering Data Editor** before using this command.

**Claim Status Dialog**

Opens when you select one or more items and select **Edit** > **Claim Status** on the main menu bar. You can review the details of the claimed state of the selected items, claim items, release the claims to items, and discover other details of the claim status. To perform an action on an item (claim, release claim, or show details), you must first select the row of the item. Hold down CTRL or SHIFT to select multiple items.

**Item Tag**

The tag that identifies the item. If a selected item that appears in this dialog does not have an item tag, the value is blank.

**Item Type**

The item type to which the item belongs, for example: Mechanical, Nozzle, PipingComp, SignalRun.

**Claimed**

Indicates the claim status of items claimed in the current project. An item claimed by your active project is denoted by ; an item with an invalid claim on it is denoted by ; an item which has a relationship with another item that has been claimed, but which itself was not explicitly claimed is denoted by (partial claim); otherwise, this field is blank.

**Claimed by Others**

Indicates the claim status of items claimed by other projects. The symbols are the same as for the **Claimed** column. If you are working in ‘Exclusive mode’, you cannot claim an item that is already claimed by another project.

**Claim**

Opens the **Claim** dialog, where you can claim the item and record claim comments.

**Release Claim**

Releases the claim from your project. A confirmation message is displayed; choose **Yes** to release the claim.

**Details**

Opens the **Details** dialog, where you can discover what project has claimed the selected item, the user that claimed it, and any claim comments that were entered when it was claimed.

**Details Dialog**

Displays details about the claim status of the item that you selected in the **Claim Status** dialog. You can discover the project that has the claim, the user that claimed the item, and claim comments that were entered when the claim was made. Because newly placed items are automatically claimed by the project that places them, their claim comments are always “New Item”. This dialog opens when you select **Details** on the **Claim Status** dialog. You can select all the items in the list by using CTRL + A, and using CTRL + C

makes the selected items available to paste into another document.

The **New Item** entry is automatically added to the comments for an item that is new to the drawing. New items are automatically claimed to the project that created them.

**Show Claims Command (View Menu)**

Sets the appearance of drawing objects as it is specified in the **Claims** tab of the **View Properties** dialog.

You can use this command to switch the claim symbology on and off. Using the options on the **Claims** tab causes only the color and line weight to change, not the line pattern.

**Display Claim Status in the Drawing Symbology**

1. Select **View** > Show Claims.
2. Select **View** > Show Claims again to turn off the display of claim status in the symbology of drawing items.

You can define the line color and weight used to designate claim status on the **Claims** tab of the **View** **Properties** dialog.

If you turn on the display of claim status in the drawing, then when you print the drawing, the claim status will be plotted.

**Releasing a Claimed Item**

If an item is initially claimed by a project, but then later it is decided that the item does not need to be modified, you can remove the item from the project scope using the **Release Claim** command. New items that are automatically claimed when they are created cannot be *unclaimed* with this command.

**Release Claim Command**

Displays the Release Claim Dialog and allows you to relinquish control (by your project) of the selected items. This dialog also displays when you attempt to unclaim an item that has been modified in the project.

Claims must be released before projects can be completed or for other projects to be able to check in drawings with changes.

In Smart P&ID only, you can use the **Compare and Refresh** command to revert the item back to the As-Built state prior to unclaiming.

If you are working in a SmartPlant environment and there are any differences between an item in the Project and an item in the As-Built, the claim cannot be released. If you are not working in the SmartPlant environment, the claim can be released. Also, items that display no warnings or errors are released.

This command can only be used for items that belong to the active drawing.

**Release Claim Dialog**

Opens when you select an item and select **Edit** > **Release Claim** on the main menu bar and displays details of the items that you select to be released from claiming.

**Items to be released**

Lists the items that are selected in the Drawing view or **Engineering Data Editor** and their details. These are the items that you release from your project when you select **OK**. You can also select multiple elements of this list. In this list, you can also see if a selected item has not been claimed nor does it have any other errors or warnings associated with it.

**Release a Claim**

1. In the Drawing view or **Engineering Data Editor**, select the items for which you want to release claims.
2. Right-click the item or select set and select **Release Claim**. If there are any errors or warnings during

the release, the Release Claim Dialog displays. Review any warnings and error messages about each item.

1. Select **OK** to complete the claim release operation.

After setting the claim mode to **Release Claim**, the status of the items still remains behave exactly in the same way as the scoped items as the software re-scopes them.

You cannot release the claim on an item that is claimed to your project if it is a new item that was created in your project.

You can also release claims on items when you display their claim status. See Display the Claim

Status of a Drawing Item.

You can only release the claim on an item in the **Engineering Data Editor** if that item belongs to the active drawing.

**Viewing Overlapping Drawings**

When a drawing is fetched or checked out to multiple projects, changes might be made simultaneously to the same object(s). The **Show Overlapping** feature allows you to compare a drawing in different projects by displaying the drawing views on top of each other. Any newly placed or modified object can thus be easily identified, and the drawing can then be edited to avoid positioning conflicts.

The **Show Overlapping** command can be executed from Smart P&ID Drawing Manager or from the Smart P&ID Modeler. In both cases, the overlapping view opens in the Smart P&ID Modeler. To enable the **Show** **Overlapping** command in Smart P&ID Drawing Manager, select any drawing in the List view.

When you execute the **Show Overlapping** command, the software fetches the latest .pid files from the selected projects and displays the overlapping view in the Smart P&ID Modeler in the display color selected on the **Overlapping** dialog. Each project displays on a separate tab.

Overlapping drawings can be viewed for a maximum of 15 projects including your currently active project and the As-Built plant.

The **Show Overlapping** command is enabled after you select a drawing from the List view in Drawing Manager.

You cannot edit the drawings in the overlapping view. To edit, you must open them from the Smart P&ID Modeler.

The overlapping view will only display the most recently saved changes.

**Finishing a Project**

Finishing a project is a two-step procedure: First, you must complete the project, and then you must merge the project back into the Plant.

**Complete a Project**

1. In Drawing Manager, open the **Project Status** dialog.
2. Select the **Complete Project** button.

This command performs several tests, including verifying all the drawings for check in. If the project passes all the tests, the project status is set to **Completed**. If the project fails to pass one of the tests, the project remains in the **Active** state and you have more work to do before completing the project.

The **Verify for Check In** command in Drawing Manager allows you to perform the same tests on individual drawings that are done by the **Complete Project** process on all drawings. This allows you to check if individual drawings are ready for check in as work on them is completed.

Before a project can be completed, all the drawings that exist in the project must be checked out (not just fetched). Checking out a drawing to a project means that this project is the only one that can check it back into the plant.

All drawings must be up-to-date with the version in the Plant. If another project has checked in changes to one of the project drawings because it was fetched from the Plant, then the project will fail to complete. In this case, you must refresh the affected drawings before the project can be completed.

This ensures that overlapping projects with shared drawings do not destroy each other’s changes. If projects do not share any drawings, this is not an issue.

**Merge a Project**

1. After completing a project, the next step of finishing the project is to merge the project back into the Plant. Merging the project causes all the changes that were made in the project to be merged back into the Plant. Prior to merging, the Plant is not affected by any of the changes that are done in the project. After merging, all the project changes are incorporated into the Plant database.In Drawing Manager, open the **Project Status** dialog.
2. Select **Merge Project**.

*This command performs the check in operation on each of the checked-out drawings and sets the* *state of the project to **Merged**.*

In some workflows, it is desirable to merge some of the drawings back into the Plant before the project is completed. Individual drawings can be merged into the Plant with the **Check In** command in Drawing Manager.

Merged projects cannot be returned to active status.

**Cancel a Project**

If you decide that a project should not be merged into the Plant, the other alternative is to cancel the project.

Canceling a project causes all the project changes to be discarded. Canceled projects cannot be returned to the **Active** status.

1. In Drawing Manager, open the **Project Status** dialog.
2. Select the **Cancel Project** button.

**Comparing and Refreshing Versions**

When more than one version of a drawing exists, you can view two versions side-by-side and examine their differences by using the **Tools** > **Compare and Refresh** command. You can compare two versions from inside your own Plant or project database, or you can compare a version in your database to a version in the Plant or another project database. Keep in mind that you can compare a drawing only against a version of itself; that is, you cannot compare one drawing to another drawing.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, the Refresh action is not allowed.

Differences between drawing versions are assigned to logical change groups, which are listed on the **Change groups** area of the **Compare and Refresh** dialog. Differences display in the following two categories.

**Graphic** refers to an item that has changed only in its graphical representation in the design; that is, the item is moved or otherwise graphically manipulated in the drawing.

**Data** refers to a mismatch in the properties assigned to an item that exists in both drawings; that is, a change, addition, or deletion of a property in the **Properties** window or **Engineering Data Editor** in Smart P&ID or through automation.

Every change grouping and every changed item is assigned a category, and if more than one category applies (for instance, if you move an item and change one of its properties), then the highest priority category is displayed.

**Change details** displays information about selected groups in the **Change groups** area. Values include the following.

**Add**

Indicates that the selected group will be added to the version displaying on the right.

**Delete**

Indicates the selected group will be removed from the version displaying on the right.

**Modify**

Indicates the selected group will be modified on the version displaying on the right.

The two versions are displayed in two Drawing views, described as left and right views. The relationship between the two views depends on whether you are comparing two versions in your own database or comparing your version to a version in another database.

**Comparing two** **versions in the active database:** The left-hand view is the older version, and the right-hand view is the newer version. That is, they are displayed in time-order from left to right.

**Comparing two versions that exist in different databases**: The right-hand view is reserved for the version in your active Plant or project database, and the left-hand view belongs to the version in another database because you cannot be assured that time-order is the logical order to display the versions.

You can also compare the differences between the typicals of either drawing. Using the select list situated in the drawing name bar of each view, you can display the primary, typical, or both views of the selected version.

When a plant item group is sent to the Plant Stockpile and after creating a new version of the drawing, that plant item group is assigned to a piece of equipment or an instrument, the **Change** column displays the value **Delete**. Plant Item Group types that are affected by this behavior are: Contract Package, Hydro Test Package, Package, Instrument Safety Class, Test System, and Hydraulic Circuit. If the plant item group is sent to the *drawing* stockpile, the behavior is identical. However, the **Change** column displays the value **Modify**.

**Compare and Refresh Command (Tools Menu)**

Allows you to refresh the active drawing with data from another version of the drawing. The differences display in what is known as a change group. If you accept the changes, the drawing refreshes to display the changes.

To refresh a project drawing, you use the drawing in the plant. hange groups are marked if it affects items you have claimed. Be sure to refresh all of the changes that do not involve claimed items because these are the changes that have been checked in by other projects. You want to include these changes in your drawing so they will not be lost when you perform a check in.

In Smart P&ID Engineering, this command is enabled; however, it is only possible to view the differences between drawings — you cannot refresh the display.

**Compare With Dialog**

Opens when you select **Tools** > Compare and Refresh allowing you to select a drawing version to compare

against the version that you currently have open and active.

**Available Databases**

Lists all the different databases that currently have a version of the drawing you chose on the **Show History** dialog.

**History**

Lists all the versions of the chosen drawing in the database you named in the **Available Databases** list.

**Drawing Views**

The left and right drawing views display the two versions of your drawing being compared. The display above the drawing view shows the drawing name and the version. The select list in the display allows you to choose the drawing layers to be compared and can be selected individually for each version. Possible select list values are **Primary**, **Typical**, or **Both**.

If you compare two versions from different projects, the version that belongs to the other project appears in the left **Drawing** view and the version that belongs to your active Drawing Manager project appears in the right **Drawing** view. If you compare two versions from your active project, then the latest version appears in the right **Drawing** view.

At the top of each **Drawing** view, the Plant or project, the name of the drawing, and the version is displayed explicitly. You can move the bars between the different views according to your needs. If you double-click on the divider between the left and right **Drawing** views, then the software automatically adjusts the two views to be the same-size.

**Properties Window**

Displays two columns of properties for an item selected in a **Drawing** view or in the **Change details** list.

The left-hand and right-hand columns correspond to the left and right **Drawing** views. If a deleted item is selected (the item exists in left view, but not the right view), the properties for that item are listed in the left-hand column and the right-hand column is empty. If a modified item is selected, values from both versions show in their respective columns in the **Properties** window. If a new item is selected, that is, the item exists in right view, but not the left view, the properties for that item are listed in the right-hand column and the left-hand column is empty.

**Properties Commands**

Allows you to customize the properties that are displayed in the **Properties** window.

**Alphabetic**

Lists properties in alphabetical order. This button acts as a toggle and is available when properties are displayed categorically.

**Categorized**

Displays properties grouped by specific categories. Categories are defined and properties are assigned to those categories in Data Dictionary Manager. This button acts as a toggle and is available when properties are displayed alphabetically.

**Show Modified**

Toggles the display of only those properties of the selected drawing item that are different in the versions.

This button applies only to modified items that exist in both versions. For added and deleted items, all properties are listed.

**Data Example**

In this example, a jacketed tower exists in the version to be selected for the compare. The current version contains the same jacketed tower but a change has been made to the **Cleaning Requirements** property. When the current version is compared to the selected version, a data change is found during the compare.

The current version appears on the right and the version it is compared to appears on the left. **Change** **groups** indicates that there is only one group and a data change was located. All items in the group are valid claims. **Change details** indicates that the comparison located a different property value (**Cleaning** **Requirement**) in the current version.

**Graphic Example**

In this example, a jacketed tower exists in the version to be selected for the compare. The current version contains the same jacketed tower but it has been moved to a new location. When the current version is compared to the selected version, a graphic change is found during the compare.

The current version appears on the right and the version it is compared to appears on the left. **Change** **groups** indicates that there is only one group and a graphic change was located.

Clicking in the **Action** column of the **Change groups** data allows you to take no action or refresh (accept the previous location of the vessel). The settings are not applied to a version until you select **OK**.

**Data and Graphic Example**

In this example, a jacketed tower with a nozzle exists in the version to be selected for the compare. The current drawing contains the same jacketed tower and nozzle. The original nozzle has been moved, a new nozzle has been added, and a property for the jacketed tower has been changed. When the current drawing is compared to the selected version, a data and graphic change is found during the compare.

The current drawing appears on the right and the drawing it is compared to appears on the left. **Change** **groups** indicates that there are three groups of differences. All items in the groups are valid claims. **Change** **details** indicates that the comparison located an existing nozzle that was moved (**Graphic**) and a property value change (**Data**) in the current drawing.

Clicking in the **Action** column of any of the three **Change groups** allows you to select either **No Action** or **Refresh**. If you select **Refresh** for any of the three groups, the action described in the **Change** column will be performed when you select **OK**.

**Consistency Checking**

Consistency checking verifies the suitability of work that a designer performs while creating the drawing.

The software verifies, in real-time, if the composition of a drawing and the underlying data model satisfy rules that your company has defined. The software includes pre-defined standard industry design propagation: for example, pipe runs inherit properties from nozzles. Additional consistency checking and design propagation are defined in Rule Manager.

Consistency checking continuously monitors your work when you change items on a drawing. The software displays all the inconsistencies, describes specific problems, and offers hints. Using these solutions, you can decide the best method to resolve an inconsistency. One solution is to approve a warning and thereby remove the inconsistency from the drawing. Another solution is to copy the same value from one side to the other side and then propagate.

This illustration shows the inconsistency indicators that highlight incorrect relationships at a junction of items in a drawing. An error appears where the pipe run connects to the pump nozzle (A). A warning appears at the point where the valve and pipe run intersect (B). An approved warning accompanies the off-page connector (C).

**Consistency Checking and Break Labels**

A property break is a point in a connected network of objects where a property value changes. A property break is an exception to the consistency criteria defined in a rule. A property break defines a limitation to the spread of the propagation scope. Whereas rules provide the general definition of the scope, property breaks provide specific limitations of the scope.

The Consistency Check Dialog shows the consistency criteria that apply at the selected relationship

indicator. All of the properties that are copied and compared across this connection are shown. After placement of a break label, the copy and compare columns show icons that indicate that no copy and compare operations are performed for the properties in the label.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, placement is not allowed; therefore this information refers to the behavior of items that were placed by a Smart P&ID user.

Break labels can be created in the **Catalog Manager** environment. A break label is created just like an ordinary label, except that the Label Type property must be set to *Attribute Break*. A SmartText field must be created for each property that the break label is intended to break. A break label can break one or more properties. This functionality is all currently supported by the Catalog Manager. No new functionality is required.

Redundant breaks do not appear as inconsistencies on drawings. To identify these, you must use the **Find Redundant Breaks** command. Redundant breaks are break components, attribute breaks, and pipe segment breaks where those properties for which a discontinuity is expected are the same on either side of the break.

**Show Inconsistencies Command (View Menu)**

Turns on or off the display of indicators that identify inconsistent relationships in the active view. The software does not mark consistent, error-free relationships.

**Show Inconsistencies**

1. Select **View** > Show Inconsistencies. When this option is selected, inconsistent relationship indicators

appear in the drawing.

1. If you do not want the inconsistencies to appear, select **View** > Show Inconsistencies again to clear

the selection of the option.

Also, you can right-click in an empty portion of the drawing to display a shortcut menu. Select Show

Inconsistencies to toggle the display of inconsistencies off and on.

**Consistency Check Command (Edit Menu)**

Right-click an inconsistency indicator and choose **Consistency Check** to display the Consistency Check

Dialog. As you create a drawing, consistency checking monitors your drawing for design discrepancies. If a location in the drawing has only one or multiple inconsistencies, you can correct the problems by reviewing them on the Consistency Check Dialog.

**Consistency Check Dialog**

Opens when you display the properties of an inconsistency indicator, and lists the inconsistencies, their specific problem area, and solutions for resolving the inconsistency. The dialog also displays the consistency criteria and propagation breaks that apply at the selected relationship indicator.

You open this dialog by right-clicking an inconsistency indicator and choosing **Consistency Check** from the shortcut menu. You can also select **Edit** > **Consistency Check**. When this dialog first appears, the software automatically selects the first item in the list. Other sections of the dialog provide details that are specifically related to the selected inconsistency.

All inconsistencies that occur at a junction, regardless of severity, are listed on the **Consistency Check** dialog. When you select one of the inconsistencies in the list, the software displays information specific to that inconsistency in the **Solutions** box. A specific example of this type can involve data inconsistencies for nominal pipe diameter, normal operating temperature, and alternate design pressure between a piping component and pipe run. This represents three different problems but at the same junction.

The **Consistency Check** dialog contains the **Inconsistencies Tab** and the **Consistency Criteria Tab**.

**Importing Drawing Data**

There are several ways you can import data into Smart P&ID Engineering. You can import data and items into the database using reports and other files. Also, you can also populate or redefine pipe run properties by importing an Aspen Basic Engineering stream data file. During the import process, you can assign the stream and its associated engineering data to the pipe run.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, importing from SmartSketch is not allowed.

**Import > Data File Command (File Menu)**

Allows you to import data and items into the database from reports and other files.

Relationships between items cannot be imported, only items and their properties.

**Import Log Dialog**

Shows the progress of the data importation process and allows you to review the log file. This dialog opens when you use the **File** > **Import** > **Data File** command.

**Import log**

Lists the results of the file importing process. These results are also available in SPImport.log, which is saved to your local TEMP folder.

**Importing Aspen Basic Engineering Stream Data**

You can populate or redefine pipe run properties by importing an Aspen Basic Engineering stream data file.

During the import process, you can assign the stream and its associated engineering data to the pipe run.

You can easily update stockpile items that originate from importing Aspen Basic Engineering data by re-importing a data file. Previously imported items, whether they remain in the stockpile or have already been placed in the drawing, are updated with data from the newly imported file.

If a format change is made to an exported Aspen Basic Engineering report, modifications must be made to the import code to accommodate the changed report layout. See the Smart P&ID

Engineering Programmer’s Help.

**Import Aspen Basic Engineering Stream Data**

1. Select a pipe run from the drawing to display the **Properties** window for the pipe run. If the **Properties** window is not open, you can select **Edit** > **Properties** after you select the pipe run.
2. Select the **Calculate** button next to the **Stream No**. cell to display the **Stream Number** dialog.

**Generating Reports**

Reporting is the process of extracting data from a database and presenting it in a formatted output. In Smart P&ID Engineering, you can create a report at any time during the design creation process and each report consists of a Microsoft Excel workbook and a report definition. The report definition specifies what data to collect and how to organize it in the workbook.

Each report that you create is based on specific item type, such as equipment, nozzle, instrument, and pipe run. The item type serves as the starting point for collecting data for the report.

The report definition contains one or more report items organized in a tree hierarchy. Every report must have at least one item to define its type, for example, an equipment item for a report about equipment. The report item provides all the available properties of each piece of equipment, but you can choose which properties to include.

You can customize reports by only adding necessary report items to access additional properties of related items. For example, include a nozzle report item to gather data about nozzles, as they are related to equipment. Relationships between the item types provide additional information for reports. When creating a report, you can only use items related to the selected item type. To understand the item relationships and map necessary properties into report templates, see Properties Glossary.

The report item’s location in the tree hierarchy affects the properties collected for the associated item type.

For example, if a nozzle is added as the top-level item in the tree, all nozzles in the database are collected for the report. If the nozzle is added as a child of an equipment, only the information about nozzles that are related to that equipment are collected.

Smart P&ID Engineering provides you with default report templates, which you can use as-is or create a custom report that meets your requirements. For more information on creating custom report templates, see

Creating and editing report templates.

We’ve upgraded Smart P&ID Engineering to .NET, as a result, you must update any custom reports that you created in versions 2014 R1 or earlier. You can update the custom reports in two ways: Automatic - When you edit or run a report, ensure to enable automatic update.

Manual - You can manually update the VBA code in Excel.

**Generate a report for an active drawing**

You can generate report on an active drawing using either the selected items or all the items in the drawing.

Ensure you have Microsoft Excel installed on your computer to view the report.

Before running any Line List report, verify that every line in the selection has an **Item Tag**.

All the generated reports are stored in the **C:\Users\[username]\My Reports\Output** folder. Replace

[username] with actual username.

For plants with projects, the software includes plant name in the Excel report in !

format. For example, if the plant name is ACPL and the associated project name is GC-EXP-001, then it would appear as ACPL!GC-EXP-001 in the report.

**Generate a report for the plant**

You can generate a plant-wide report based on default views or custom views.

Ensure you have Microsoft Excel installed on your computer to view the report.

Before running any Line List report, verify that every line in the selection has an **Item Tag**.

1. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, select a view depending on the items to include in the report. For example, to generate a plant-wide equipment report, select **Equipment**.

display the specific information that you want. So the software allows you to define report templates in several different formats and with all manner of information from the design database.

You can create report templates in three different formats:

Tabular Format Report

Fixed Format Report

Composite Format Report

The delivered report templates are all tabular format reports. Fixed and composite format templates allow the greatest amount of freedom in formatting your report.

Not only can you completely control the format of your report, but you can control the content of the template also. Each report is based on a unique item type, and the properties that are associated with that item type are readily available to include in your report. In addition, any item that is related in any way to the basic item type of your report makes its properties available to include in the definition of your template, too.

For instance, the properties of inline components and instruments can be used in a pipe run report because inline components are related to their pipe runs. In order to discover how items and their properties are related, and thereby how you can map the properties that you want into your report templates, see the *Properties Glossary*, which is included in the glossaries attached to *Smart P&ID Engineering Help*.

**Portable report templates**

In previous versions of the software, when a property is mapped to a report template, the template file stores an internal identifier for that property; thus, that report template is tightly linked to the plant that creates the property. Now the property *name* is mapped into the report template; therefore, as long as all plants use the same property name, the same report template is valid.

When creating a new report template, the software saves the file *.xlsm for Excel 2007 or a newer version and *.xls for older versions of Excel.

For the reports to work properly, ensure that the **Safe mode (helps limit the control’s** **access to your computer)** is selected in Excel **Options** > **Trust Center** > **Trust Center Settings** > **ActiveX Settings**.

**Enable Automatic Update of Custom Reports**

From Version 2019, the VBA code was updated for all shipped reports in accordance with the software migration to .NET. In order to make a similar update for your custom reports, this procedure explains how to enable custom reports by injecting a new VBA function automatically whenever you run a custom report.

1. Open Microsoft Excel on your computer where you want to run your reports.
2. From the sidebar at the left, select **Options**.
3. In the **Excel Options** dialog, from the sidebar, select **Trust Center**.

1. Select **Trust Center Settings**.
2. In the **Trust Center** dialog, from the sidebar, select **Macro Settings**.
3. Under **Developer Macro Settings**, select the check box **Trust access to the VBA project object** **model**.

**Update Custom Reports Manually**

From Version 2019, the VBA code was updated for all shipped reports in accordance with the software migration to .NET. In order to make a similar update for your custom reports, this procedure explains how to enable custom reports by updating the VBA code manually.

1. Open the desired Excel report template.
2. Display the Microsoft Visual Basic environment by pressing ALT + F11.
3. In the **Project** pane, under **Microsoft Excel Objects**, select **ThisWorkbook**.
4. Locate the function *Public Sub RunWorkbook()* and rename this function *Public Sub* *RunWorkbookEX()*.

If your custom report came from an earlier version of Smart P&ID Engineering which did not include the *Public Sub RunWorkbook()* function, skip the rest of this procedure, and instead, copy the entire *Public Sub RunWorkbookEX()* function at the end of **ThisWorkbook**. The function appears in step 4 of the topic Improve the Performance of Custom Reports.

1. In this function, replace the following line of code:

Set objRunWorkBook = CreateObject(“RunWorkBook.clsRunWorkBook”) with:

Set objRunWorkBook = CreateObject(“RunWorkBook2019.clsRunWorkBook”) 6. Save your changes and close Excel.

**Improve the Performance of Custom Reports**

From Version 2009 SP2, new VBA code was added to all shipped reports, resulting in significantly improved generation time. In order to enable similar performance improvements for your custom reports, you must add this VBA code to each report template.

This code does not improve the performance of reports that previously took approximately 10

seconds or less to generate.

1. Open the Excel report template.
2. Display the Microsoft Visual Basic environment by pressing ALT + F11.
3. In the **Project** pane, under **Microsoft Excel Objects**, select **ThisWorkbook**.
4. Add the following code to the Excel report workbook code sheet: Public Sub RunWorkbookEX()

’ The objRunWorkBook object creates a separate connection for Excel.

’ This object holds the DataPile object for later use within the report.

’ You can get the DataPile object by calling the property get objRunWorkBook.DataPile

’ This code does not improve the performance of reports that took approximately 10 seconds or less to generate.

**Tabular Format Report**

All the delivered report templates are tabular format reports. When the report is generated, all properties populate the report by using the same format defined for the first row by means of macros. In other words, tabular format reports are row-based. The **Options** command on the **Add-Ins** tab of the Excel sheet is important for setting aside space for the header and empty rows between lines in the report because the placement of report item properties is restricted in the tabular format report template.

For example, the report template for an Equipment List can appear like this: Equipment Name

Equipment Description

Equipment Type

#Equipment::Name#

#Equipment::Description#

#Equipment::Type#

When the report is generated, the output appears like this:

Equipment Name

Equipment Description

Equipment Type

D-100

Horizontal Drum 100

Horizontal Drum

T-100

Potable Water Tank

Vertical Tank

**Define the Layout of a Tabular Format Report Template**

You can edit your tabular format report template in Microsoft Excel and specify how the labels and data are displayed.

1. On the **Add-Ins** tab of the Excel sheet, select **Options** .
2. In the **Report Options** dialog, choose the size of your report header by setting a value in the **Rows in** **report header** option.

The header is part of the tabular format report template where data is not mapped based on rows. That is, you are free to type a label and map report item properties anywhere in the lines that you designate for your header.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 316/573

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The header is a good place to put information that applies to all the items in your report, such as Unit or Plant Name.

Also, you can add graphics in your report header.

Be sure to include space in your header for the labels of your columns.

If an item property is added in the header and more than one value for that property exists (including null values), separate tabs will be created in the generated report for each common value; for example, if items of equipment appear in a report with the **Number of Trays** property shown in the header area, where vessels have 2 or 3 as the number of trays and where trays are not applicable for other equipment items, three tabs will appear in the report: one for items having 2 trays, one for items having 3 trays, and one for items that do not include the **Number of Trays** property (null value).

1. Choose the number of empty lines that you want between rows in your report. Each row is filled with properties for one item.

Some report templates, for example some Line List reports, designate two rows of data for each report item and then an empty row.

1. If you want to sort the map properties, under **‘Map Properties’ sort order**, select **Ascending** or **Descending**.

When sorted in ascending or descending order, the properties that have sub-properties appear first sorted alphabetically, followed by the properties that do not have sub-properties, sorted alphabetically.

For a summary report, the list entry **Report Item Group Total** that appears at the lowest level is always at the bottom of the list, regardless of the sort order selected.

1. Select **OK** to close the **Report Options** dialog.
2. Complete general labels and graphics, if needed, in your header.
3. Complete column headings in the last row of your header.
4. Select a cell in your report template where you want to map a particular property.

This cell can be either in the body of the report or in the header.

1. Choose the property that you want to map to your cell from the **Map Properties** menu. The items on this menu are chosen when you define the contents of your template. See Define the Contents of Your Report Template.

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

You only have to map each item property once in the template. Values of the properties for all the items will appear in subsequent rows in the generated report and will follow the format you map for the first instance of the item.

Only one property can be mapped to a given cell, although the same property can be mapped to more than one cell.

1. Repeat the previous steps until you have mapped all the properties that you want to include in this report template.
2. Save the template and exit Microsoft Excel.

The file location of plant-level report templates is specified in Options Manager.

For PID users, the file location of user-level templates is defined on the **Files** tab of the **Options** dialog (**Tools** > **Options**).

If you add any property value in a cell belonging to a row allocated as part of the header, a new Microsoft Excel worksheet is created and the header is saved on the new sheet because the entire header no longer fits in the space allotted on the first sheet. You can customize the number of rows in the report header by using the **Options** command on the **Add-Ins** tab and choosing a larger value in the **Rows in report header** option in the **Report Options** dialog.

**Fixed Format Report**

The fixed format report creates one Microsoft Excel worksheet for each item. When defining the report template, you only edit the first worksheet. When you generate your report, all fixed format worksheets, one for each item of the report item type, follow the format of the first Microsoft Excel worksheet. The **Options** command on the **Add-Ins** tab of the Excel sheet is not available for editing a fixed format report template because you are free to place headers and data anywhere you want on your worksheet.

**Define the Layout of a Fixed Format Report Template**

You can edit your fixed format report template in Microsoft Excel and specify how the labels and data are displayed.

1. Choose a cell on your Microsoft Excel worksheet and type labeling information into it.

A label is not a required feature of a fixed format report template. You can simply map properties to cells without any labeling if you want.

1. Choose a cell where you want the property associated with the labeling to appear.
2. On the **Add-Ins** tab of the Excel sheet, select **Map Properties** and from the menu select the property that you want to map to the cell you chose in the previous step.

The properties on the **Map Properties** menu are specified when you define the contents of your report. See Define the Contents of Your Report Template.

1. Repeat the previous steps until you have labeled and mapped all the needed report item properties to the corresponding locations in your template. When you generate a fixed format report, the data for each report item appears in its own worksheet, and the layout for each worksheet matches the layout defined for the first worksheet.

The **Options** command is not available on the **Add-Ins** tab for fixed format report templates because you are free to place headers and data anywhere on your worksheet.

**Composite Format Report**

For the composite report format, the software creates two Microsoft Excel worksheets for each item type.

You only edit Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 of the workbook. When you generate the report, all the worksheets, two for each item type, follow the format of Sheet 1 and Sheet 2. In the report, properties of the recently added item are displayed in Sheet 1 and Sheet 2. The properties of all other items added before the recent item are displayed in the subsequent sheets.

The delivered report templates are tabular format. Therefore, choose **Blank** from the **Source** **template** list if you want to create a composite format template.

The format for Composite report and Fixed report is similar. Difference between the two is that the Fixed report has one sheet, and the Composite report has two sheets for each item.

**New Report Template Dialog**

Displays options for creating plant-level and user-level report templates. This dialog opens when you select **Reports** > **New** on the main menu bar.

**Source template**

Lists the names of all existing report templates and **Blank**. You select a user-level template, plant-level template, or **Blank**. The **Blank** option creates a Microsoft Excel workbook with no predetermined formatting information. If you chose **Blank**, you must specify an item type; whereas, if you do not choose **Blank**, the software automatically displays the item type that corresponds to your source template. Templates in this list appear in alphabetical order.

**Name**

Allows you to enter a meaningful name to describe the report that you are creating. This name matches your Microsoft Excel workbook. The software appends .xlsm to the name when you save the Excel workbook.

**Item type**

Defines the item properties available in your report. If you do not select a **Blank** source template type, then the **Item type** option automatically displays the item type that corresponds to your source template.

**Report Type**

Specifies your report format. Available options include fixed, tabular, and composite. All delivered report templates are tabular format.

Select this check box to display the selected units of measure in the report. Clear the check box to display the property values without units of measure.

Formats with primary, secondary, and tertiary units are truncated to the primary value with no rounding when the units are not displayed. Therefore if you clear the **Display units of measure** check box, you might not get accurate results when using such a format. If you do not want to display units of measure, consider using a format that has primary units only.

Use caution when importing a report that contains numerical values without units of measure. In such cases, these numerical values will be imported using the plant default formats, potentially altering the items’ properties. For example, if a report was created with a temperature in Celsius without displaying the units (using an alternative format), a numerical value of 100 in the report (intended as 100 ºC) will be imported as 100 ºF (37.78 ºC) into a plant with ºF as the plant default.

**Display Properties with Units Using an Alternative Format**

This procedure explains how to specify a particular format for displaying in a Smart P&ID Engineering report the value of a property that has units of measure. The software displays the numeric value in accordance with the conversion formula specified for the selected format. The user can specify whether to include the units of measure with the displayed value.

Let us assume that the property you want to display is ‘Design Max Pressure’ and that the default format is Pressure-psig.

If the default format is chosen, the value of that property will be displayed in the report with the units of measure defined for that format. The string that appears in the cell is:

#Pipe Run::Design MaxPress::ProcessDesign.Max.Pressure#

If an alternative format named ‘Pressure-BarG’ was chosen to display the property, the string that appears in the cell is:

#Pipe Run::Design MaxPress::ProcessDesign.Max.Pressure[Pressure-BarG]#

**Map Properties Command**

Displays a menu of all properties associated with your report. This menu is populated with the items that you define using the **Define** command on the **Add-Ins** tab. The **Map Properties** menu contains a subset of all the properties in the plant database.

You can select a cell in your report template and then assign a property from the **Map Properties** list. The software places the corresponding property in the selected cell. You do not have to map all the properties in the **Map Properties** menu, and you can add properties to the menu by using the **Define** command again.

The **Add-Ins** tab appears in Microsoft Excel when you create or edit a report template.

**Printing Drawings**

You can print your drawings on many different devices ranging from dot matrix printers to laser printers and plotters. Except for the color settings and a few special effects, your drawing prints exactly as it appears in the Drawing view. This stipulation applies to special settings like the display of claimed items, inconsistency indicators, or filtered items.

Print an entire drawing or specific views from a drawing.

Set printing options, such as the range of sheets or number of copies to print.

The software supports plotting using standard Windows plotting capabilities. It also supports pen plotters, subject to the limitations of the device driver. Items look the same on the screen and in the printed drawing.

However, the fonts you select can affect the match between what you see on the screen and what appears on the printed page. Three kinds of fonts affect your work: scalable fonts, printer fonts, and screen fonts.

Use scalable fonts, such as TrueType® fonts, to make sure that what you see on the screen is what appears on the printed page. If you use printer fonts, you must have a corresponding screen font and font size to display each font on the screen. If each screen font you use has a matching printer font, the screen display of the drawing closely matches the printed drawing.

**Printing Part of a Drawing**

You can print selected sheets in a drawing or a selected area. This feature is handy if you are working on a complex drawing and you want to print only certain parts to proof them. You can print all views or certain views. You can print not only drawing items that are selected, but other items that are in the view with the select set print.

**Printing Time**

Drawings can take some time to print. Expect longer print times when you have drawings that contain a large number of the following items:

Curved items

Many fills that have complex colors, patterns, or textures

Large bitmaps

Links to various drawings

The type of printer you have also affects the printing time. PostScript® printers print faster than LaserJet printers, because they can make the necessary calculations faster. Some older versions of PostScript®

printers are slower when compared to the newer ones. The type of controller boards and the amount of RAM in the printer also affect your printing times.

**Integration with SmartPlant Foundation**

Integration standardizes and improves the communication among the various authoring tools you use in the course of designing, constructing, and operating a plant. Integration manages data exchange among these authoring tools, which enables sharing and re-use of plant information throughout the plant life-cycle.

SmartPlant Foundation acts as a repository for data and a medium through which information is shared among other tools, such as Smart Instrumentation, Smart Electrical, and Smart 3D.

Most integration commands are available on the **SmartPlant** menu in Smart P&ID Engineering Drawing Manager and **Integration** menu in Smart P&ID Engineering.

The following graphic displays what Smart P&ID Engineering publishes and retrieves and shows the flow of data and the different types of data.

Smart P&ID Engineering interacts with SmartPlant Foundation by correlating items between the plant database and the SmartPlant Foundation database by retrieving documents from SmartPlant Foundation.

Also, Smart P&ID Engineering creates a set of tasks in the To Do List that you can run to update the plant database. In Smart P&ID Engineering, you can also use the commands on the **Integration** menu to publish documents and retrieve data, access SmartPlant Foundation to browse data, and subscribe to change notifications and compare documents.

You can only use the **Integration** menu commands after your plant is registered. See Registering

Tools.

**Tool Requirements for Integrating Smart P&ID**

This topic describes rules and settings that allow Smart P&ID Engineering data to be shared correctly with Aspen Basic Engineering, Smart Instrumentation, Smart 3D, and the other tools that are part of an integrated environment. Other tools that are not listed here have no known Smart P&ID

Engineering/integration issues.

**General Integration Requirements**

The following is a list of *best practice* scenarios for using Smart P&ID Engineering so that data will migrate correctly to other tools:

When creating formats for use with Smart P&ID Engineering publishing, the formats must be added and mapped in SPPIDDataMap.xml using Schema Editor. The UID string of the custom SPMapUOMDef map file must be of the form *SPMU__* , where ‘NN’ represents the SPMapUOMListDef ID for the format type (for example Temperature = 5; Pressure = 27). Because spaces or restricted characters are not allowed in the UID string, custom format names must not include spaces or restricted characters.

If you intend to publish select lists (enum lists) to SmartPlant Foundation, make sure that you review the SmartPlant Adapter for Smart P&ID Engineering Help to understand the requirements (see under *Data Transformation Logic* > *Publish/Retrieve*).

If the Smart P&ID Engineering item tag validation allows for duplicate tags, this might have an impact on downstream tools such as Smart Instrumentation, which does not allow duplicates. In such cases, allowing duplicates in Smart P&ID Engineering can cause problems in the retrieving tool.

By default, Smart P&ID Engineering item tag validation does not allow duplicate item tags for loops or instruments.

**Integration with Smart Instrumentation**

**Retrieving Documents**

If a Smart P&ID Engineering drawing that includes items with a flow direction is to be retrieved by Smart Instrumentation, a flow direction of **End 1 Upstream** or **End 1 Downstream** must be defined in Smart P&ID

Engineering. Bi-directional flow is not supported.

**Connect to Process Lines**

**Connect to Process** lines are required for connecting instruments to equipment nozzles and pipe runs in Smart P&ID Engineering.

All non-piped offline equipment instruments must be connected to vessels through non-electric signal lines and nozzles in Smart P&ID Engineering. This enables Smart Instrumentation to recognize that instruments are connected to vessels.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 349/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

If Smart P&ID Engineering assigns an object to an intermediate level in the hierarchy and publishes, Smart Instrumentation assigns the object to the level in the hierarchy in Smart Instrumentation determined by their logic. Because instruments belong to units in Smart Instrumentation, an instrument assigned to the intermediate level in Smart P&ID Engineering will be assigned to the unit in Smart Instrumentation. Panels will be assigned to the plant. Smart P&ID Engineering might get an update on retrieve to move the object to another level in the hierarchy than where it was published based on the move done automatically by Smart Instrumentation. Panels will move to the top level; instruments will move to the bottom.

**Instrument Expansion**

A Smart P&ID Engineering instrument or loop tag does not always have a 1:1 relationship with instruments in Smart Instrumentation. In some cases, a single item tag in a P&ID corresponding to an instrument or loop needs to be expanded to create several instruments when publishing the data for Smart Instrumentation.

For this purpose, the **Expansion Type** property in Smart P&ID Engineering specifies the expansion behavior when publishing an instrument or loop. Each value of the property corresponds to a Smart Instrumentation rule that determines which instrument types and numbers are to be created in Smart Instrumentation when the Smart P&ID Engineering tag is expanded and retrieved.

When retrieving data back to Smart P&ID Engineering, the behavior of a particular instrument created by expansion is determined by Smart Instrumentation parameters. For an expanded instrument, the state of the IRetrievableExpansion interface determines whether that instrument will be retrieved by Smart P&ID Engineering: if the IRetrievableExpansion interface is realized, the instrument is retrieved, whereas if the IRetrievableExpansion interface is *not* realized, the instrument is not retrieved. The ‘parent’ item tag is *always* retrieved, regardless of the realization state of the IRetrievableExpansion interface.

**Ports**

Smart Instrumentation uses physical ports, while Smart P&ID Engineering uses logical ports. Smart Instrumentation publishes the physical ports with the Dimensional Data Sheets and not the Instrument Index. Smart P&ID Engineering retrieves the Instrument Index and does not retrieve the Dimensional Data Sheets.

When the workflow goes from Smart P&ID Engineering to Smart Instrumentation, followed by Smart Instrumentation publishing the Dimensional Datasheet, a Same As relationship is created between the ports in the SmartPlant Foundation database. That Same As relationship is required by Smart 3D to correctly match the design basis ports to the 3D representation of the ports.

However, when the workflow goes from Smart Instrumentation to Smart P&ID Engineering, a Same As relationship is not created in the SmartPlant Foundation database. Without the Same As relationship created in the SmartPlant Foundation database, the result might be additional ports in Smart 3D. To obtain the Same As relationship on the ports requires that Smart P&ID Engineering publish the P&ID with the instrument, this P&ID be retrieved by Smart Instrumentation and then having Smart Instrumentation publish the Dimensional Data Sheet.

**Integration with Smart 3D**

**General**

In Options Manager, ensure that under **Settings**, the **Use Piping Specification** setting value is **Smart 3D**

even if the P&ID plant is not validating piping specifications. This is to ensure that the required Piping Component Select List entries are properly set to match the PIP short codes expected by Smart 3D. See *Configure Piping Specification Settings* in Smart P&ID Engineering * * Options Manager User’s Help.

**Drawing Items**

For Smart 3D to properly determine flow direction in a process run, that process run must be connected to at least 2 items.

Some items that can be represented as single objects in Smart P&ID Engineering, such as Vent Detail, are modeled in Smart 3D as a set of separate objects. For full correlation to be established between the two tools, ensure that these objects are modeled in Smart P&ID Engineering with the same configuration used to represent them in Smart 3D.

**Properties**

Smart 3D handles temperature and pressure properties in pairs and does not support having a temperature (for example, Normal Operating Temperature) without defining the matching pressure (in this case, Normal Operating Pressure). While this is a valid condition for Smart P&ID Engineering, it should be a consideration when publishing for retrieval into Smart 3D. Without the Pressure / Temperature pair of values defined, the Smart 3D user will be required to enter a value that was not defined in Smart P&ID Engineering.

**Integration with Aspen Basic Engineering**

**Retrieving Documents**

Basic Engineering data sheets can contain multiple objects and can be formatted in a traditional data sheet view or list view (for example, as an equipment list). Data sheets retrieved from Basic Engineering might include stream data, specialty piping data, or relief valve data as required by business practices.

**Using the Catalog Index in Smart P&ID Engineering and SmartPlant Integration** When you select the **Retrieve** command, the software accesses the CatalogIndex.mdb and the system performs the following actions:

1. Using the retrieved document, the object type and classification of the retrieved item is determined.
2. Using the Smart P&ID Engineering Map file, the ItemTypeName (Equipment, PipeRun, PipingComp, Loops, and so forth), and codelist indices for Class, Sub-Class, and Type are determined.

**Catalog Index Lookup**

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 351/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The Catalog Index file is used to find a symbol in the catalog with type properties that match the given values. The lookup is performed using the most specific information first. If a match is found, that symbol is used. However, if there is no match, the more generic type information is used for additional searches. In this way, a generic symbol will be returned if no specific symbol is available in the catalog.

**Search Based on Type Value**

Searches the catalog index for all rows with matching ItemTypeName and Type values and IsDefaultForType = True. If one or more rows are found, the software uses the CatalogItemName from the first one. If no match is found, the software performs the search based on Subclass.

**Search Based on Subclass Value**

Searches the catalog index for all rows with matching ItemTypeName and SubClass values and IsDefaultForSubclass = True. If one or more rows are found, the software uses the CatalogItemName from the first one. If no match is found, the software performs the search based on Class.

**Search Based on Class Value**

Searches the catalog index for all rows with matching ItemTypeName and Class values and IsDefaultForClass = True. If one or more rows are found, the software uses the CatalogItemName from the first one. If no match is found, the software returns an empty string.

**Using Workshare in an Integrated Environment**

The following rules apply to using the Workshare functionality in an integrated environment: You can enable and disable Workshare before or after registering a Greenfield plant.

You can create satellites and connect to them after registering.

You cannot register a satellite or a project host.

You cannot retrieve a PBS document when Workshare is enabled.

Satellites must transfer drawing ownership back to the host in order for the host to publish the drawings and in order for retrieved documents to have tasks updated within the satellite drawings.

**Using the Smart P&ID SmartPlant Menu Commands Within a Workshare Collaboration** The Workshare host can perform actions using the following commands from within Smart P&ID when registered in an integrated environment:

**Publish**

Any drawing can be published.

**Retrieve**

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Any document can be retrieved.

**Correlate**

Available to review correlations only if the drawing is read-only with respect to Workshare. No other correlation activity is allowed for read-only drawings. If the drawing is owned with respect to the Workshare site, then all correlation activities are available.

**To Do List**

Only available at the Workshare Host for drawings opened with read-write privileges. For drawings opened in read-only mode, commands that modify a drawing, such as the **Run To Do List** task, are not available.

To Do List tasks can be reviewed on drawings for which the host does not have ownership, but these tasks cannot be executed unless ownership is assigned to the Host. The To Do List is not available at the Satellite.

**Upgrade Schema Command**

Upgrades the existing SmartPlant schema associated with the active plant to a newer version.

The software upgrades the SPPIDDataMap.xml file, including user customizations, with the latest version data from the files in the ..\SmartPlant\P&ID Workstation\bin folder path and registers the schema version at the beginning of the .xml file.

**The SmartPlant Adapter and Tool Schema**

The tool schema implements a mapping between the objects in the Smart P&ID Engineering data model and the objects in SmartPlant schema. If you customize either the Smart P&ID Engineering data model or the SmartPlant schema, you might also need to customize the mapping contained in the tool schema. The following describes the structure of the tool schema and how it is used by the Smart P&ID Engineering adapter to support the publish and retrieve functions.

Publish

When a P&ID drawing is published, the Adapter extracts data from the Smart P&ID Engineering database and converts it into a set of objects and relationships that are compatible with the SmartPlant schema.

These objects and relationships are written out to an XML file and are sent to the SmartPlant Server for further processing. The adapter depends on the data in the tool schema to support the publish operation.

For each published class in the tool schema, there is a code module in the adapter known as a Class Publisher. The Class Publisher contains code for the following tasks: **Query the P&ID Database**:** **The Class Publisher queries the database to obtain the collection of items to be published.

**Create a Data Object**:** **For each item to be published, the Class Publisher creates a data object in the document container. The class of this object is the SmartPlant schema class related to the MapClass https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 353/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

via the MapClassToClass relationship.

**Set the Property Values**:** **The property values on the data object are set according to the values on the Smart P&ID Engineering item. The list of properties to be published is defined by the list of MapProperties related to the current MapClass.

**Publish Relationships**:** **The Class Publisher defines the types of relationships that are to be published for each data object it publishes.

Retrieve

When a document from another authoring tool is retrieved, the adapter compares the objects in that document to the data in the Smart P&ID Engineering database and generates tasks in the To Do List. A Create task is generated when a new item needs to be created. An Update task is generated when an existing item needs to be modified. A Delete task is generated when an existing item needs to be deleted.

The adapter depends on the data in the tool schema to support the retrieve operation.

Generation of Create, Update, and Delete tasks can, if required, be suppressed for specified document types, for example, for objects that are not correlated between the publishing and retrieving tools.

See Suppress Generation of Tasks on Retrieve.

For each retrieved class in the tool schema, there is a code module in the adapter known as a Class Retriever. Each Class Retriever contains code for retrieving a class of objects.

When a document is retrieved, the adapter receives two containers of data.

1. The document container includes all of the published objects and relationships for that document.
2. The tombstone container includes information about deleted objects and relationships.

The adapter iterates over all of the objects in the document container and performs these actions: **Use Identifying Interface to Determine Class**:** **The incoming object is tested for an identifying interface to determine which Class Retriever should handle the retrieval of that object.

**Generate Update Task**:** **The Class Retriever searches for an existing Smart P&ID Engineering item to update. If an item is found, it generates an Update task in the To Do List. The properties of the incoming object are compared against the properties of the existing item. When differences are found, property updates are added to the task. The list of properties to be compared is defined by the properties in the tool schema.

**Generate Create Task**:** **If no item is found to update, a Create task is generated in the To Do List.

Property updates are added to the task for each of the incoming property values. The list of properties to be added is defined by the properties in the tool schema.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, it is not possible to run Create tasks.

**Retrieve Relationships**:** **The Class Retriever defines the types of relationships that are to be retrieved for each data object.

The adapter iterates over all of the objects in the tombstone container and performs these actions: **Generate Delete Task** — The adapter searches for an existing item in the Smart P&ID Engineering database that is correlated to the item that was deleted in the other application. If such an item is found, a Delete task is generated in the To Do List.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, it is not possible to run Delete tasks.

For properties that use enumerated lists to publish, you must add EFAdapter.EnumConversions to the process criteria when you define the map property definition in the tool schema.

When you create a new enumerated list definition in the tool map file, you must replace the system-generated UID for the list with SP_<Codelist_Index>, for example, SP_12001. The codelist index is located in the Enumerations database table for the Smart P&ID Engineering Data Dictionary user in the Smart P&ID Engineering database.

When you create enumerated list entries in the tool map file, you must replace the system-generated UID for each list entry with SP_<Codelist_Index>_<Codelist_Number>, for example, SP_12001_1.

The codelist index for the enumerated list and the codelist number for the entry are located in the Enumerations and Codelists database table for the Smart P&ID Engineering Data Dictionary user in the Smart P&ID Engineering database.

If you want Smart P&ID Engineering to create line numbers at publish time so that they match the displayed labels on the P&ID, you can modify the process criteria for the ItemTag map property definition in the publish map for the PipeRun tool class. To change the format for line numbers, modify the process criteria for the ItemTag, and add the properties that you want to include in the item tag inside angle brackets (<>) after EFAdapter.PpConnNameConv. For example, EFAdapter.PpConnNameConv, - --

- . The property names inside the angle brackets must match property names in the map file.

If you want Smart P&ID Engineering to create the Pipe Run name at publish time so that it matches the ItemTag value in the Smart P&ID Engineering **Properties** window, you can remove the special adapter method seen in the map file (as delivered it appears as EFAdapter.PpConnNameConv,

- 

). This prevents the software from performing name conversion when generating the Pipe Run name.

You can specify for Smart P&ID Engineering to create the Pipe Run name at publish time so that it displays any pipe run properties that you require. To do this, you add the properties that you want to https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 355/573

include in the item tag inside angle brackets (<>) after EFAdapter.PpConnNameConv. However, note that the name conversion supports only those properties that belong to the Pipe Run.

To ensure that data is published for the pipe ScheduleOrThickness property, you must specify the data so that it matches the entries in the ‘Schedule or Thickness Standards’ Enumeration list under the SmartPlant Foundation schema.

**Tool Schema Location**

The Smart P&ID Engineering tool schema is named SPPIDDataMap.xml. This file must exist in the folder specified by the SmartPlant ResourcePath setting in Options Manager. When a new plant is created, you must define the value of this setting and ensure that the file exists in that folder. During publish and retrieve operations, the adapter looks for that file in that location.

**The Tool Schema Data Model**

The following graphic displays a representation of the objects and relationships that are relevant to the Smart P&ID Engineering tool schema.

The rectangles on the left side of the graphic represent objects in the tool schema. The rectangles on the right represent objects in the SmartPlant schema. The relationships that connect objects on the left with objects on the right are the mapping relationships. The map file contains both the tool schema objects and the mapping relationships.

**MapClass**

The MapClass object corresponds to the IMapClassDef interface in the Mapping Relationships diagram. In general, there is a MapClass object in the tool schema for each Smart P&ID Engineering class (ItemType) that needs to be published or retrieved. MapClass is referred to as SPMapClassDef in the Schema Editor.

The properties and relationships for a MapClass can be viewed in the **Edit Map Class Definition** dialog.

Process Criteria

This property must be filled in for this

MapClass to be used. The format for this

property is a comma delimited list of

fields. The fields are:

**ProgID**:** **The programmatic identifier

of a class module within the

Adapter.

**Expand Attributes Flag**:** **A flag to

indicate if the attributes should be

expanded.

**Seq No**:** **A number that indicates the

sequence in which the classes are

processed. This field is used for

Retrieve processing.

The user should not change any

of these values. The default values that

come with the delivered Tool Schema

should remain unchanged. One exception

to this is if you want to ignore the retrieval

of items in the specific class, as described

in the example below.

To ignore an item for retrieval, delete all the parameters from the **Process Criteria** property for the required map class. For example, to prevent retrieval of PipeRuns, delete the parameters for the EFAdapter.PipeRunDataExchanger map class.

**Property Conversions**

If the data type of the Smart P&ID Engineering property does not match the data type of the mapped property in the SmartPlant schema, a data type mismatch exists. In some cases, a property with a data type mismatch can still be published and retrieved using specialized code. The code to perform these data type conversions and other special handling is implemented in special Property Conversion objects. The SmartPlant adapter is told about the need to use a Property Conversion object by putting the ProgID of the Property Conversion class in the **Process Criteria** option of the MapProperty. The list of available Property Conversion classes is shown in the table below.

The ProgID for each of these classes is formed by prefixing the class name with the string

‘EFadapter’.

**Property Conversion Class**

**Description**

BoolToEnumConv

supports the conversion needed

to publish and retrieve the

Smart P&ID Engineering

SP_IsSpecialtyItem property

to/from the

CommoditySpecialtyType

property in the SmartPlant

TagPrefixConv

This class implements the

property conversion code for

for instrumentation.

UoMToDoubleConv

This class implements the

property conversion code

between UoM and Double. This

property conversion module is

specifically targeted to handle

conversion of attributes without

units (such as Molecular

Weight, CpCvRatio,

Compressibility,

SpecificGravity). In Smart P&ID

Engineering these attributes are

treated like UoM attributes.

However, in the SmartPlant

schema they are simply Double.

UoMToEnumConv

This class implements the

property conversion code

between UoM to Enumerated

List.

**Hierarchical Enumerated Lists**

A hierarchical enumerated list is a complex data type in which there is a collection of related enumerated lists and a value in a higher level list constrains the valid values in a lower level list. When a hierarchical enumerated list is used, a separate property is created for each level in the hierarchy.

Examples of hierarchical enumerated lists in Smart P&ID Engineering are Equipment Class, Equipment Subclass, Equipment Type, and Fluid System, Fluid Code. Examples in the SmartPlant schema include: EqType0, … , EqType6, and ConstructionStatus, ConstructionStatus2.

When mapping between Smart P&ID Engineering and the SmartPlant schema, four cases must be considered.

1. Simple enumerated list to simple enumerated list.
2. Simple enumerated list to hierarchical enumerated list.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 370/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

1. Hierarchical enumerated list to simple enumerated list.
2. Hierarchical enumerated list to hierarchical enumerated list. When mapping between two hierarchical enumerated lists, the number of levels in each hierarchy might not be the same.

**EnumConversions**

A special Property Conversion class is available to support publishing and retrieving of enumerated properties. This class is called EnumConversions, and it is used for all cases of mapping enumerated list properties.

**Mapping Properties**

Only the top level properties associated with a hierarchical enumerated list are mapped. The lower level properties are left unmapped. The EnumConversions object obtains all of the values from the set of related properties even though they are not explicitly mapped.

**Tool Schema Relationships**

The MapEnumList objects that form an enumerated hierarchy must be related to each other with the Constrains and Constrained By relationships. The EnumConversions object relies on these relationships to get the job done.

**Mapping Enum Values**

An enumerated value within an enumerated list hierarchy can be mapped to any value (at any level) in the target enumerated list hierarchy. There is no explicit relationship between the levels of two hierarchies.

**Catalog Index**

During retrieval of a document, when a create task is generated, the adapter must select a symbol to be used by the task. The adapter uses the Catalog Index to quickly find a suitable symbol to be used. The Catalog Index lookup is based on the *type* properties. For example, when generating a create task for Equipment, the Equipment Class/Subclass/Type properties are used to perform the lookup. Before the Catalog Index lookup can take place, the incoming SmartPlant type values must be converted into Smart P&ID Engineering type values. This conversion of a SmartPlant schema enum value into a Smart P&ID

Engineering enumerated value is performed by the EnumConversions object just like any other enumerated property value. It depends on the mapping of enumerated values found in the tool schema.

**Drawing**

There is a MapClass in the tool schema for Drawing. The MapProperties for this MapClass define the properties that will be published from the Smart P&ID Engineering Drawing item to the SmartPlant schema PIDDrawing object. If new properties are added to the Drawing item type in the Data Dictionary Manager, and corresponding new properties are added in the SmartPlant schema, then they can be mapped by adding new MapProperties to this MapClass in the tool schema using the Schema Editor.

**Equipment**

In Smart P&ID Engineering there is an abstract class for Equipment with four subclasses for Vessel, Exchanger, Mechanical and OtherEquipment. In the SmartPlant schema, there are four PID equipment classes.

1. PIDProcessVessel
2. PIDHeatTransferEquipment
3. PIDMechanicalEquipment

## 4. PIDProcessEquipment

The tool schema has a MapClass for each of the four equipment subclasses in Smart P&ID Engineering and another MapClass for the abstract Equipment class.

**Publish**

The four MapClasses map the corresponding equipment classes in Smart P&ID Engineering and the SmartPlant schema. A Smart P&ID Engineering vessel is published as a PIDProcessVessel in SmartPlant; an Exchanger is published as a PIDHeatTransferEquipment, and so forth. The MapClass for Equipment does not play any role in the publish operation.

**Retrieve**

When a document is being retrieved, each incoming object is tested for identifying interfaces to determine what type of object it is. The object is first tested for the identifying interfaces for Vessel, Exchanger, Mechanical and OtherEquipment. If the object has one of these identifying interfaces, it is retrieved as that specific type of equipment (using the MapProperties associated with the specific MapClass for that equipment class in the tool schema). If the object is not recognized by its interfaces as any of these specific equipment types, but it is recognized as Equipment, it is retrieved as generic equipment (using the MapProperties associated with the generic Equipment MapClass in the tool schema).

**Instrument**

In Smart P&ID Engineering there is one Instrument class.

In the SmartPlant schema, there are three PID instrument classes.

PIDInstrument

PIDInlineInstrument

PIDControlSystemFunction

The tool schema has three MapClasses.

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Instrument

InstrumentInline

InstrumentCtrlSysFunc

The Smart P&ID Engineering adapter has three separate Class Publisher/Retriever objects for these three classes.

**Publish**

All Smart P&ID Engineering instruments with Instrument Class equal to System Function are published as PIDControlSystemFunction using the InstrumentCtrlSysFunc MapClass. All Smart P&ID Engineering instruments with IsInline equal to True are published as PIDInlineInstrument using the InstrumentInline MapClass. All other Smart P&ID Engineering instruments are published as PIDInstrument using the Instrument MapClass.

**Retrieve**

All objects that have the IControlSystemFunction interface are retrieved as Instruments using the InstrumentCtrlSysFunc MapClass. All objects that have the IInstrumentOcc interface are retrieved as Instruments using the PIDInlineInstrument MapClass.

The **InstrLoop** map class in the tool schema is used for the instrument loop, which is usually retrieved when retrieving the associated instruments. To retrieve instruments from Smart Instrumentation without their associated loops, for the **InstrLoop** map class **Process Criteria** property, change the string

‘EFAdapter.InstrLoopDataExchanger,False,7’ to ‘EFAdapter.InstrLoopDataExchanger,False,7**,False**’ (add an

extra ‘False’ parameter with a comma separator at the end). For more details, see MapClass.

**PipeRun**

In Smart P&ID Engineering there is a single class for PipeRun. This class has properties describing aspects of the physical pipe and other properties that describe the fluid flowing through that pipe. In the SmartPlant schema there are two relevant classes: PIDPipingConnector for the pipe itself and PIDProcessPoint for the process data. Furthermore, the SmartPlant schema has several classes that are used to publish a stream and its associated process data on a PFD. The Smart P&ID Engineering tool schema has one MapClass for PipeRun.

**Publish**

Each Smart P&ID Engineering PipeRun is published as a PIDPipingConnector and a PIDProcessPoint with a relationship between the two. Some of the properties from the PipeRun are mapped to the PIDPipingConnector and others are mapped to the PIDProcessPoint.

**Retrieve**

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 373/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

When an object is retrieved with the IPipingSystemConnector interface, it is recognized as a Stream and is retrieved using the PipeRun MapClass to create or update a PipeRun. The ProcessDataCaseComposition relationship is traversed to obtain objects that realize the IProcessDataCase interface. From those objects, the ProcessDataBulkComposition relationship is traversed to obtain objects that realize the IProcessDataBulkPhase interface. Properties from all of these SmartPlant schema objects can be retrieved onto the Smart P&ID Engineering PipeRun object.

**Select Criteria**

In the Schema Editor, the **Select Criteria** option on the MapProperty is used to indicate to the adapter how to handle each property for both publish and retrieve. The format of the **Select Criteria** option is: **Select** **Criteria** = %

Indicates where the property comes from during retrieve. If this value is empty, it means that the property comes from the primary object being retrieved (IPipingSystemConnector). If a value exists, it means that this property comes from one of the secondary objects that is related to the primary object by means of a relationship.

This is a string that indicates where the property goes during publish. If this value is empty, it means that the property is published to the primary object (PIDPipingConnector). If this property is has a value (it should be equal to ProcessPoint), it means that this property is published to the related PIDProcessPoint object.

**PipeLine**

In Smart P&ID Engineering, graphical pipe runs indicate the schematic piping design. You can assign naming properties to these pipe runs. All of the pipe runs with matching values for the naming properties form a logical group. Such a group is sometimes called a pipeline and the values of the naming properties represent the name of the pipeline. All of this is done without requiring you to explicitly create a pipeline object.

In the SmartPlant schema there is an explicit PIDPipeLine class. Objects of this class must be published with relationships to the associated PIDPipingConnectors. Some downstream applications depend on the existence of the PIDPipeLine for their processing.

The Smart P&ID Engineering adapter creates and deletes pipelines dynamically during the publish operation. The pipelines and the relationships to the pipe runs are published as if they really existed in the Smart P&ID Engineering database. The tool schema contains a MapClass for PipeLine. The MapProperties for the pipeline MapClass define the properties that are published to the PIDPipeline object.

**Special Smart P&ID Engineering Mapping Procedures**

The procedures in this section explain how to specify whether particular items or relationships are to be included in or omitted from publish or retrieve actions.

Publish with Instrument Expansion

Retrieve Expanded Instruments

Define Mapping Relationships as ‘For Documentation Only’

Publish the ‘OwnsComponentOcc’ Relation

Suppress Generation of Tasks on Retrieve

**Publish with Instrument Expansion**

You can enable the expansion of a single published instrument from Smart P&ID Engineering into a set of instruments in Smart Instrumentation (including the original instrument).

Instrument expansion is executed in Smart Instrumentation in accordance with the particular expansion type selected by the user in Smart P&ID Engineering.

To enable data exchange with SmartPlant Foundation and other tools, the schema version in use must include the following Interfaces:

**Retrieve Expanded Instruments**

When retrieving an instrument, any number of instruments that were generated by expansion (from none to all of the expanded instruments) can also be retrieved. The actual number of expanded instruments that are retrieved is determined by rules implemented in Smart Instrumentation.

To enable data exchange with SmartPlant Foundation and other tools, the schema version in use must include the following Interfaces:

The IExpandableThing.ExpansionType Interface holds the expansion rules list. IExpandableThing is only realized for expanded instruments, but not for the original instrument. The original instrument is always retrieved.

The IRetrievableExpansion Interface determines whether the item is to be retrieved by Smart P&ID

Engineering.

The following table summarizes how the realization of these interfaces determines whether or not an instrument is retrieved.

**Define Mapping Relationships as ‘For Documentation Only’**

MapPropertyToProperty or PropertyToMapProperty relationships that are set to ‘for documentation only’ are included in tool schema mapping to show that mapping relationships exist between the map property and the property definitions but that the support for these mapping relationships is hard-coded (and is therefore only included in the mapping for documentation purposes).

Set ‘for documentation only’ mapping relationships as follows:

1. In Schema Editor, open the **Edit Map Class Definition** dialog.
2. Select the **Publish** or **Retrieve** tab.

The ‘for documentation only’ mapping relationships appear as dashed arrows (instead of solid arrows which indicate standard mapping relationships).

1. To change the setting, select the rows from the bottom pane, and select an arrow in the **Map Type** column.
2. On the dialog that opens, toggle the **For documentation only?**  value between **True** and **False** as needed.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 380/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

If you set a value to **True**, the application adapter ignores the mapping relationship and uses hard-coded logic which should already be defined.

**Publish the ‘OwnsComponentOcc’ Relation**

OwnsComponentOcc is a relation between a pipe run and piping component that is used to determine which pipe segment the piping component is related to. To include this relation when publishing, the user must update the map file as described below.

1. Open the Tool schema in the Schema Editor.
2. Open the SPPIDDataMap.xml on the **Tool Schema** tab.
3. Under the **SPMapRelDef** node, right-click **OwnsComponentOcc** and on the shortcut menu, select **Edit OwnsComponentOcc**.
4. On the **Edit Map Relationship Definition** dialog, beside **Maps to**, select the ellipsis button and

from the list of EFSchema RelDef items, select **OwnsComponentOcc**.

**Suppress Generation of Tasks on Retrieve**

When retrieving documents in Smart P&ID Engineering, it is possible to suppress the generation of Update tasks for specified document types by adding code in the **Select criteria** field for the appropriate MapClass object (SPMapClassDef).

To ensure the maintenance of data integrity in other tools, after you have made the definitions in a particular MapClass object for suppressing the generation of tasks and you subsequently publish drawings, do not change or remove those definitions during the course of the integrated project.

1. Open the Tool schema in the Schema Editor.
2. Open the SPPIDDataMap.xml on the **Tool Schema** tab.
3. Expand the** SPMapClassDef **node.
4. Scroll down to the **PipeRun** map class and right-click the node.
5. On the shortcut menu, select **Edit PipeRun**.

A special DocType called “Deleted and Unclaimed Objects” can be published by applications.

This DocType contains published objects which were moved and then later deleted – for example, all objects in the Instrument Index in Smart Instrumentation could be published once and then subsequently published with a filter applied. The software now identifies those objects excluded by the filter as moved (unclaimed). If you then delete any of those unclaimed objects and publish again, the objects will appear in the “Deleted and Unclaimed Objects” DocType. To ensure that “Deleted and Unclaimed Objects” are included when suppressing the generation of Delete tasks, you should include in the **Select criteria** field “Deleted and Unclaimed Objects”, with the understanding that this document will be retrieved automatically from all applications when necessary.

**Code Syntax**

Use the following code syntax for suppressing task generation:

NoDeleteTasksForDocTypes=[DocType1;DocType2;…;DocTypeN]/NoCreateTasksForDocTypes=

[DocType1;DocType2;…;DocTypeN]/NoUpdateTasksForDocTypes=[DocType1;DocType2;…;DocTypeN]

where the code elements are as follows:

**NoDeleteTasksForDocTypes** suppresses generation of Delete tasks for the specified document types.

**NoCreateTasksForDocTypes** suppresses generation of Create tasks for the specified document types.

**NoUpdateTasksForDocTypes** suppresses generation of Update tasks for the specified document types.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, it is not possible to run Create or Delete tasks.

A forward slash (/) separates the commands for each task type (Delete, Create, Update).

For each task type, the document type names or IDs are separated by a semicolon (;) as shown: In this example, EE82 is the ID for PFD documents, and EE84 is the ID for Instrument Index documents.

To find the name or ID of a document type, go to the retrieved document and use the ‘DocType’

property value of the **IDocument** interface.

**Code Example**

The following code is used to suppress generation of Create and Delete tasks for PFD and Instrument Index documents (using document type names and IDs) including Delete tasks for deleted and unclaimed objects: NoCreateTasksForDocTypes=PFD;EE82;Instrument

Index;EE84/NoDeleteTasksForDocTypes=PFD;EE82;Instrument Index;EE84;Deleted and Unclaimed Objects

1. In the Desktop Client, set your scope for the applicable plant, and then find the CMF file.
2. Right-click the CMF file, and then select **Edit > Check Out** to display the **Check Out** dialog.
3. Select **OK**.
4. In the **New Items** window, right-click the new version of the CMF file, and select **Launch Schema** **Editor**.
5. On the** Set Active Configurations** dialog, select the schema version that you want to view.For more options, select **Advanced**.
6. Select **OK** to set the configuration.

The CMF file must be checked in to SmartPlant Foundation before users can publish from an authoring tool.

By default, changes to the SmartPlant Schema are written to all versions managed by the CMF file.

Although you can choose to write changes to only selected versions, we do not recommend doing so.

If you choose to view one version of the schema (**Specify configurations to display** window) but write changes to all versions (**Set Configurations for new objects** window), an information window appears when you select **OK**, indicating that you will be prompted with every change to the schema to confirm that you want to write the changes to all versions. Select **OK** to continue.

1. In the Schema Editor, select **File >**  **SmartPlant** > **Edit Engineering Tool Options,**  and select **SMARTPLANTPID** from the list of authoring tools to load the Smart P&ID Engineering tool map schema.
2. Under **Startup** options, select the **Load map schema** and **Connect to application schema** check boxes, and select **OK**.
3. In each row in the **Synchronize** dialog, the values in the tool database and tool map schema columns indicate actions to correct inconsistencies between the tool metadata and tool map schema.

the appropriate action in each row, and then select **OK**.

Each row represents a discrepancy between the tool database and the tool map schema.

Default actions are blue when the **Synchronize** dialog displays. However, if you select a different option, it will become blue instead.

In many cases, only one operation is supported to synchronize the tool database and tool map schema. For example, if a new property was found in the database, the metadata adapter can add the property to the tool map schema, but it cannot remove the property from the tool database.

Because the Smart P&ID Engineering tool map schema does not have a map class definition called Plant Item, the new property that you added appears on several map class definitions that inherit from Plant Item, such as equipment component and instrument loop.

**Open the Instrument Loop Map Class Definition**

After the tool map schema is synchronized with the database, the **Map Environment** window appears, providing tools for creating mapping relationships to be stored in the tool map schema file.

1. In the **Map Environment**, expand **Smart P&ID Engineering** > **Loaded Map Schemas** > **Smart P&ID**

**Engineering Tool Schema**.

1. Expand the **Map Classes** node, and right-click **InstrLoop**.

1. Select **OK**.

If the SystemCode property does not appear in the **Unmapped SmartPlant properties** list after you created and exposed it on the ICustomInterface interface definition, check the ICustomInterface definition to make sure that it is realized by the PIDInstrumentLoop class definition and implied by the IInstrumentLoop interface.

The view definition that creates the list of unmapped properties is generated by the software the first time you access the **Edit** form for a map class for each Schema Editor session. So, if you view the list, leave it, and make changes, such as adding additional interfaces to the class definition to which the map class is mapped, the changes you made will not appear when you return to this form because the view definition is not updated or regenerated. You will see the changes during your next Schema Editor session.

**Map the SystemCode Property for Additional Map Class Definitions** Because multiple Smart P&ID Engineering classes inherited the SystemCode property, you can create additional mapping so that other objects can publish the property.

1. In the **Map Environment** tree view, right-click **Instrument**, and then select **Edit Instrument** on the shortcut menu.
2. Select the **Publish** tab.
3. Under **Unmapped application properties**, select **SystemCode**.
4. Under **Unmapped SmartPlant properties**, select **SystemCode**.
5. On the toolbar, select **Map**

.

1. Repeat steps 1-5 in this section to map the SystemCode property for any Smart P&ID Engineering map class definitions that represent objects for which you want to publish this property.

To create a retrieve mapping relationship for a property, follow the same steps on the **Retrieve** tab.

**Save the Tool Map Schema and SmartPlant Schema Changes**

Select **File** > **Save** **All Modified Files** to save the SmartPlant schema changes (CMF file) and the tool map schema.

When you close the Schema Editor, the software prompts you to save your connection information, user interface options, and loaded tool map schemas to a session file. Select **Yes** in the message box to save the session file so that you can use it to return to this working environment. However, you should not open a session file after launching the CMF file from the Desktop Client.

If you save changes to the CMF file or a tool map schema but did not validate the changes before exiting, the software displays an information message to remind you that the file contains changes that have not been validated. Select **OK** to dismiss the message.

If you make changes to the SmartPlant schema, you must load the changes into the SmartPlant Foundation database.

Additionally, if you made changes to the SmartPlant schema, you should regenerate the component schemas for the site before testing any publish or retrieve mapping relationships.

definition to make sure that it is realized by the PIDInstrumentLoop class definition and implied by the IInstrumentLoop interface.

The view definition that creates the list of unmapped properties is generated by the software the first time you access the **Edit** form for a map class for each Schema Editor session. So, if you view the list, leave it, and make changes, such as adding additional interfaces to the class definition to which the map class is mapped, the changes you made will not appear when you return to this form because the view definition is not updated or regenerated. You will see the changes during your next Schema Editor session.

**Map the EngSys Property for Additional Map Class Definitions**

Because multiple Smart P&ID Engineering classes inherited the EngSystem property, you can create additional mapping so that other objects can publish the property.

1. In the tree view, right-click **Instrument**, and then select **Edit Instrument** on the shortcut menu.
2. Select the **Publish** tab.
3. Under **Unmapped application properties**, select **EngSystem**.
4. Under **Unmapped SmartPlant properties**, select **EngineeringSys**.
5. On the toolbar, select **Map**

.

1. Repeat steps 1-5 in this section to map the **EngSys** property for all Smart P&ID Engineering map class definitions that represent objects for which you want to publish this property.

To create a retrieve mapping relationship for a property, follow the same steps on the **Retrieve** tab.

**Save the Tool Map Schema and SmartPlant Schema Changes**

Select **File** > **Save** **All Modified Files** to save the SmartPlant schema changes (CMF file) and the tool map schema.

When you close the Schema Editor, the software prompts you to save your connection information, user interface options, and loaded tool map schemas to a session file. Select **Yes** in the message box to save the session file so that you can use it to return to this working environment. However, you should not open a session file after launching the CMF file from the Desktop Client.

If you save changes to the CMF file or a tool map schema but did not validate the changes before exiting, the software displays an information message to remind you that the file contains changes that have not been validated. Select **OK** to dismiss the message.

If you make changes to the SmartPlant schema, you must load the changes into the SmartPlant Foundation database.

Additionally, if you made changes to the SmartPlant schema, you should regenerate the component schemas for the site before testing any publish or retrieve mapping relationships.

**Smart P&ID Engineering Example: Mapping Equipment Classes to Publish** **Process Data**

The following mapping example describes how to map process data for the four Equipment classes: Equipment Other, Exchanger, Mechanical, and Vessel. The following example explains how to map process data for the Vessel class. However, a similar procedure applies to all the Equipment classes listed above.

The following must exist in the PIDComponent schema:

IProcessPoint and IProcessDataCaseComposition are realized by PIDProcessVessel, PIDMechanicalEquipment, PIDProcessEquipment, and PIDHeatTransferEquipment.

IProcessDataCaseComposition is implied by IPIDMechanicalEquipmentOcc, IPIDProcessVesselOcc, IPIDHeatTransferEquipmentOcc, and IEquipmentOcc.

PIDProcessVessel, PIDMechanicalEquipment, PIDProcessEquipment, and PIDHeatTransferEquipment must realize the interface that exposes the SmartPlant property definitions to which you want to map. For example, in this topic, you will map ProcessOperatingMaxTemperature** **to PhaseTemperatureMax, which is exposed by IBulkMaxProcessPoint. To map a ProcessOperatingMaxTemperature property to PhaseTemperatureMin, the class definition should realize IBulkMinProcessPoint.

**Before You Extend the Smart P&ID Engineering Database**

1. Make a backup of the SmartPlant Foundation site database and any vaults for the site.
2. Create a backup of Smart P&ID Engineering, including a database backup from the plant level with reference data, an application-level data dictionary template (DDT), and a backup of the SPPIDDataMap.xml file located in the SmartPlant resources directory.

This method is called by SmartPlant Client and needs to be implemented to modify, add, or remove information from the data to be published before transmitting to SmartPlant Foundation. This implementation can also validate the published data and raise messages during the publish process. It can also update the publish progress bar with the status of each step.

By implementing this method, you can achieve the following:

Modify or add information to the published data that cannot be handled by the tool adapters.

Filter and limit information from the data being published.

Calculate additional information based on the publishing application data, such as finding the beginning P&ID number for a pipeline.

Manipulate data to represent special business rules.

Validate data and raise an “invalid” state to EFClient to stop the publish process.

To log messages, make sure *MessageIContainer* is set, and add the messages to *MessageIContainer*. The messages are saved to a log file.

To display progress steps in the publish progress bar, implement *ListOfProgressSteps()*. For each step, call *StepProgressBegin(stepName)* before and *StepProgressEnd(stepName)* after. Use the member variable of type *IEFCustomPublishEventHandler* with *SetEventHandlerObj()*.

See Sample Implementation (IEFCustomPublish).

**Registering Tools**

Before you can publish and retrieve documents from any of the other authoring tools, such as Smart Instrumentation or Smart Electrical, you must register each plant in Smart P&ID Engineering with a SmartPlant Foundation database (for Integration 1.0) , HxGN SDx2 database (for Integration 2.0) or an Aspen Basic Engineering™ (ABE) database. On registering your plant, the connection allows Smart P&ID

Engineering to use the **Integration** menu commands. Registration is performed by the System Administrator in Smart Engineering Manager and each plant must be registered only once in an authoring tool.

The software maps a plant and its relevant projects for SPF to a unique integration tool URL, which connects to a single integration tool plant database and its projects. When you use the **Register** command in any of the authoring tools, you are registering an authoring tool plant with the integration tool URL and plant that you specify.

You can register a plant with either SmartPlant Foundation or HxGN SDx2, but not both. After the plant is registered with one of these integration tools, the option to register with the other tool is disabled on the **Integration** menu in Smart Engineering Manager.

If a plant is registered with HxGN SDx2, only the **Reshare** command is available on the **Integration** menu in Smart P&ID Engineering, and the **SmartPlant** menu becomes unavailable in Drawing Manager.

A plant that is registered with SmartPlant Foundation or HxGN SDx2 can also be registered with ABE, and vice versa.

If a plant is registered only with ABE, only the **To Do List** command is available on the **Integration** menu. If you subsequently register an ABE plant with another integration tool, other relevant commands on the **Integration** menu become available.

**Accessing the SmartPlant Foundation Web Client**

The SmartPlant Foundation Web Client provides a web-based user interface that allows you to interact with SmartPlant Foundation. From this interface you can perform a number of tasks, such as browse data and documents that have been published, use the SmartPlant Foundation To Do List to complete workflow https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 429/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

tasks, compare document revisions and published documents with tool data, and subscribe to documents to receive notification of document changes.

**Access the SmartPlant Foundation Web Client**

In the authoring tool, select **Integration** > Browser.

This command is available only if you have registered the active plant using the SmartPlant Registration Wizard. See Smart Engineering Manager help.

From the SmartPlant Foundation Web Client, you can perform a number of tasks, such as publishing or retrieving documents, comparing documents, subscribing to document changes, and so forth. Many of these tasks can be performed from the authoring tools, such as Smart P&ID Engineering or Smart Electrical, but the Web Client provides unique access to other features such as the Web Client To Do List and search capabilities.

**Browser Command**

Opens the SmartPlant Foundation Web Client, from which you can perform a number of tasks, such as browsing for documents that have been published, using the SmartPlant Foundation To Do List to complete tasks, comparing documents in the SmartPlant Foundation database with the data in your authoring tool, and subscribing to documents to receive notification of changes to the documents.

This command is available only if you have registered the active plant using the SmartPlant Registration Wizard.

**Publishing Documents**

In an integrated environment, you must publish documents containing the drawing data and relationships before the authoring tools can share this information. The publishing process involves selecting a document to publish, assigning it to a workflow (if necessary), and specifying a revision and version of the document if specified in SmartPlant Foundation. For most documents, the associated data is included in the publishing process.

The authoring tools publish data in XML format. The software then places the .XML file in the appropriate SmartPlant Foundation vault and loads the data from the .XML files to the SmartPlant Foundation database.

After the document is published, users can retrieve the data from the .XML file in the SmartPlant Foundation vault into other authoring tools.

When you publish documents, the software does the following things: Creates a new master document and the first revision in SmartPlant Foundation the first time you publish a particular document. From that point on, the software creates new versions and revisions when the document is subsequently published. The software relates revisions to the master https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 430/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

document. You can publish subsequent revisions into a workflow, which can be a different workflow than assigned in the original publish. Changes in the document status of a related revision change the status of the subsequently published versions and revisions of the document.

Publishes a visual representation of the document that you can view without the authoring tool. For many applications, this is an Intergraph proprietary file, called a RAD file. The viewable file can also be an Excel spreadsheet or another viewable file type, such as .pdf or .doc. You can review and mark up the visual representation of the document, which is attached to the document revision, using SmartPlant Markup.

Publishes associated data, depending on workflow approval. If the data is approved and loaded, it is used for reporting and subsequent retrieval by downstream applications when the tools retrieve latest data. The software publishes only meaningful engineering data. The published data is not enough to re-create the document in the originating tool.

Places the published .XML file and any view files in the appropriate SmartPlant Foundation vault. This

.XML file can be retrieved when users in the authoring tools retrieve as-published data.

Sends notification to the publishing tool.

For more information about revisions and versions, see Revisions and versions.

**Reasons to Publish**

You can publish documents and associated data for several reasons: To exchange and enhance data among tools, to avoid creating data multiple times in multiple authoring tools

To report on common data originating in multiple tools

To provide enterprise-wide accessibility to published documents

To manage change, including workflow history and document revision management You can also publish documents to share information with users in other tools without going through a formal workflow. To share data, you can publish a document to a “for sharing” workflow that has only a load step, so that the data in loaded into SmartPlant Foundation as soon as you publish the document.

You can also publish a document by not assigning the document to a workflow, but rather by using the default workflow from SmartPlant Foundation. When you do not select a workflow for a document during publishing, the SmartPlant Loader Manager loads the document into SmartPlant Foundation as soon as it reaches the top of the Loader queue.

**Publishing Documents**

Each authoring tool publishes different documents and data. The following list contains each authoring tool that is part of integration, the document types that each tool publishes, and information about whether data https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 431/573

Plant Breakdown Structures (PBS)

Project Breakdown Structure

Project Definition Documents

Instrument Master Lists

The PBS document published by SmartPlant Foundation contains information about the physical plant with a structure consisting of plants, areas, and units. The default structure is plant/area/unit, but you can define a custom hierarchy in the Schema Editor. When a PBS document is published from SmartPlant Foundation, the authoring tools are notified about the plant, areas, and units that need to be created in each authoring tool.

The project breakdown structure, project definition document, and project list contain information about projects and their statuses. When these documents are published from SmartPlant Foundation, the authoring tools are notified of projects and contracts that need to be created in the authoring tools.

The project breakdown structure contains a single project and the hierarchy of contracts under that project in a plant/project structure. The project definition document contains information for a single project that needs to be created in the authoring tool. The project list contains a list of all projects in a plant, and it is used by those authoring tools that create all projects at one time.

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The plant breakdown structure and project breakdown structure used in the authoring tools must match the structure in SmartPlant Foundation for publishing from the authoring tools and object correlation to work correctly.

When you publish data from an authoring tool, you might not be able view all the properties that you published in the SmartPlant Foundation client. You can customize view definitions to allow you to see additional properties. For more information about defining view definitions in the SmartPlant schema, see Working with View Definitions and Create a View Definition in the Schema Editor User’s Guide.

For further assistance with visualizing data in SmartPlant Foundation, contact Intergraph Support Services.

When publishing from a project, an instruction container, which contains all the claimed objects, is created within the tombstone file.

**Publishing Files without Data**

You can also browse to and publish other file types, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or SmartSketch files. These documents are always published without data. The primary reason to publish documents without data is so that you can manage document changes and reviews using workflows and view the document electronically using the SmartPlant Foundation Change Management functionality.

**Publishing from Smart P&ID Engineering - Work Process**

- This step applies to a plant that is configured to use SmartPlant Foundation revisions. If your plant is configured to use Smart P&ID Engineering revisions, a new revision is added in the Smart P&ID

Engineering **Revise** dialog.

For details of the revision procedure, see *Smart P&ID Engineering Drawing Manager Help*.

If multiple documents are selected, only the properties with the same value for all documents are displayed. Any properties with varying values across the documents appear as blank values in these fields.

You can change some of the values assigned to one or more documents by changing the values displayed in the table. The values you enter here will override any existing values for all selected documents.

**Find Documents to Publish dialog - Document Types**

Allows you to specify the types of documents to find for publication.

**Document types**

Indicates the types of documents the software should consider when deciding which documents should be published.

**Revising Documents**

The software implements drawing revisions in different ways depending on your work environment. If you are working in an integrated environment, when you select the **Revisions** > **New Revision** command in Drawing Manager, the software opens either the SmartPlant Foundation **Revise** dialog or the **New** https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 446/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

**Revision** dialog, depending on the option selected in Options Manager for the **Revision Management** **Software for Publishing Documents** setting. If you want to associate a version with a new revision in an integrated environment, you must select the drawing and run the **Revisions** > ** Associate Version** command in Drawing Manager after creating the revision.

The document revision process is separate from the publishing process, making it possible to revise a document locally and in SmartPlant Foundation and save the revision values to the tool database without re-publishing the document.

Revising a document creates a revision for the document with major and minor revision values set, depending on the revision schema selected. When revising a document, you can modify the major and minor revision data on the document.

You can change the revision scheme after a document has been published, skip revision numbers, and manually add a revision number, then have it validated against the revision scheme. It is not required to assign a minor revision number. Also, revision data from tools is supported even if the document has previously been revised in SmartPlant Foundation.

You can revise a document by using any previous revisions that are available from the last published revision.

**Example**

If you revise a new document using the revision scheme RevAlpha (A, B, C, D…) and revision C, then SmartPlant Foundation reserves revision number C for the document. Revising the same document with RevAlpha, you can now revise with any previous revision numbers, such as A or B. However, if the document is published to SmartPlant Foundation with revision number C, you are not allowed to go back to the previous revision numbers.

The following table contains the available revision numbers based on the document revision state in SmartPlant Foundation:

**Document revision state**

**Next available revision number**

Working (C)

C and up

Current (C)

D and up

The combination of the major and minor revision values must be unique in the plant, or when working with As-Built, in the project.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 447/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

When you check out or fetch a drawing from the As-Built into a project, only the last revision record is displayed in the **Revision History** dialog, regardless of whether that revision is associated with a version or not.

Deletion of revisions is allowed in a non-integrated environment. Deletion of revisions is also allowed in an integrated environment where revisions are managed by Smart P&ID Engineering, provided the revised drawing has not yet been published and regardless of any permission settings. Revision deletion is performed in the **Revision History** dialog.

**Retrieving Documents**

When you retrieve documents into an authoring tool, you are retrieving the document data that was published by another authoring tool. For example, in Smart Instrumentation, you can retrieve engineering information from a published P&ID into the Smart Instrumentation database.

The authoring tools provide commands that let you select a document and retrieve it into that tool. You can use either the **Integration** > **Retrieve** command to open a wizard that assists you in retrieving applicable documents, or with some authoring tools, you can configure an automatic retrieval feature.

When you publish a 3D model, you must now enable the **Scheduler** and **Loader** in SmartPlant Foundation to make the 3D model data document retrievable. The load, consolidate, and merge tasks must complete successfully before the 3D model document can be retrieved.

The software trims all leading and trailing spaces from all strings and from all values without units of measure. These spaces do not appear in the retrieved data file.

Additionally, you can access the Web Client through the **Integration** > **Browser** command. This allows you to select the document or documents that you want to retrieve from your Web Client To Do List, the tree view, or by using the Web Client search functionality. After you select the documents that you want to retrieve, you can use the **Retrieve** command on the Web Client **Integration** menu to start the retrieval process.

The **Retrieve** command provided in the authoring tools is slightly different from the **Retrieve** command available in the SmartPlant Foundation Web Client. The Web Client presents a list of documents from which you can select those you want to retrieve. However, when you use the command from an authoring tool without first selecting documents, the software searches the SmartPlant Foundation project for documents to retrieve, and these are presented in a list on the **Retrieve** dialog.

You can retrieve a document in two ways:

**As published**

Retrieves only the data the authoring tool originally published with the selected revision and version of the document. Retrieving as-published data retrieves the .XML file the authoring tool published from the appropriate SmartPlant Foundation vault.

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

**With the latest data**

Retrieves the latest data associated with the selected document in the SmartPlant Foundation database. If another, more-recently published document contains updates to objects in the selected document, the software retrieves the most current data in the SmartPlant Foundation database for those shared objects.

When you retrieve the latest data, SmartPlant Foundation generates an .XML file containing the published data.

**Document Types for Retrieval**

The types of documents that you can retrieve depend on the authoring tool you are using. The following lists include the documents that each authoring tool can retrieve:

**All Authoring Tools**

From the authoring tools, you can retrieve the plant breakdown structure (PBS) and project documents. The PBS and project documents, created in SmartPlant Foundation and published, are retrieved by authoring tools to provide information about the plants, areas, units, projects, and contracts that need to be created in the authoring tool so that the information is consistent across all authoring tools.

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The PBS document published by SmartPlant Foundation contains information about the physical plant with a structure consisting of plants, areas, and units. The default structure is plant/area/unit, but you can define a custom hierarchy in the Schema Editor. The project breakdown structure, project list, and project definition document contain information about the project or projects and their statuses in a plant/project structure.

Retrieving the project breakdown documents and the PBS into Smart Engineering Manager creates the appropriate structures automatically.

When using Smart Instrumentation, you must create the plant hierarchy according to the PBS

information in SmartPlant Foundation before you retrieve either the PBS or the project definition document. You must create a plant hierarchy with at least three levels with a minimum of one unit before you can retrieve the PBS and project definition document.

When working in a project, retrieval is not available.

For certain document types, the tool schema definition can specify that To Do List tasks (Create, Update, or Delete) will not be generated for those document types. See Suppress Generation of Tasks

on Retrieve.

**Data Handling After Retrieval**

The authoring tool that you use also determines how the system deals with changes in downstream data when you retrieve a document. Smart P&ID, Smart Instrumentation, Smart Electrical, and Aspen Basic Engineering analyze the impact of the newly retrieved data on the existing database, and then place tasks on the authoring tool’s To Do List that allows you to modify items at the appropriate time in the design process. The To Do list gives you the opportunity to view and understand potential changes before accepting your changes. In Smart 3D, you can view the P&ID using the **View** > **P&ID** command to pull in the data and correlate items.

**Design Basis**

Objects that tools retrieve from other authoring tool documents can become the design basis for objects in downstream documents. Objects that become the design basis for other objects can be specific objects that get richer as they move through the life-cycle or can be schematic or logical objects in one application that evolve into more detailed objects downstream.

Design basis is implicit based on retrieval; you do not have to define it. For example, a pump retrieved from a PFD becomes the design basis for a pump in the P&ID. When you change common properties for the pump and retrieve the changes into Smart P&ID, tasks to update property values automatically appear in the To Do List. The same process works for logical items that are a design basis for other items, such as a stream in Aspen Basic Engineering that results in multiple pipe runs in Smart P&ID, or a P&ID tag in Smart P&ID can evolve into a control loop with associated tag numbers in Smart Instrumentation.

Otherwise, the retrieval process begins as soon as you select **OK**.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) documents, such as the Project List, Project Definition, and Project Breakdown, and Plant Breakdown Structure (PBS) documents are considered Administrative documents by the software and must be retrieved by all tools that subscribed to these types of documents.

So, even when these documents are new to the tools (have not been retrieved by the tool before), they are still listed in the **Documents to be retrieved only** list because they must be retrieved.

**Correlation**

Correlation can be defined as establishing a design basis for an item that has a separate representation in two tools. For example, an instrument can share a design basis between Smart P&ID Engineering and Smart Instrumentation; if data for that instrument is updated and published from one of the tools and then retrieved in the other tool, an Update task is generated for the correlated item.

In many cases, a one-to-one relationship exists between an item in an external application and an item or items in the drawing software. For example, a piece of equipment defined in Aspen Basic Engineering usually maps to a single equipment item in Smart P&ID Engineering. In these cases, after correlation has taken place, it is not possible to correlate the item in Smart P&ID Engineering with any other item in the external application unless the item is first uncorrelated. In addition, if an item that has a design basis is deleted and then published in the external application and afterwards retrieved in Smart P&ID Engineering, a Delete task will appear in the To Do List for the correlated item.

Correlation of the same item with different applications occurs independently.

For some types of piping, a single item in the external application is associated with multiple items within the drawing software. For example, a single stream item in Aspen Basic Engineering normally maps to multiple pipe runs in Smart P&ID Engineering. The **Correlate** command allows you to review and manage these relationships within the drawing environment.

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

**Automatic Correlation**

Automatic correlation takes place when you run a task in the To Do List for an item that does not have an existing design basis. This can occur in the following situations: A newly-created item in the external application that does not have a matching item tag in Smart P&ID

Engineering is retrieved in Smart P&ID Engineering. This results in the generation of a Create task.

When this Create task is run, the item is created in the Smart P&ID Engineering drawing and is automatically correlated with the item in the external application.

Automatic correlation does not take place for items that are initially created in the plant stockpile, such as loops. Such items must first be moved to the active drawing stockpile and then correlated manually.

An item in the external application that has a matching item tag in Smart P&ID Engineering and non-identical mapped properties is retrieved in Smart P&ID Engineering. This results in the generation of an Update task. When this Update task is run, the properties of the item are updated in Smart P&ID

Engineering and the item is automatically correlated with the item in the external application.

**Manual Correlation**

Manual correlation is available on the To Do List for Create tasks only, and is allowed under the following conditions:

The selected item cannot have an existing design basis for the same tool from which the item was published.

The selected item must be of the same item type as the item for which the Create task applies.

If a catalog item exists for the selected item, its catalog item type must be the same as the catalog item type defined for the Create task.

For more information, see *Perform Manual Correlation*.

**Uncorrelating Items**

When a design basis exists for an item, the item can be uncorrelated in one of the following ways: On the To Do List, you can uncorrelate items from their Update or Delete tasks. See Uncorrelate Items

from the To Do List.

Using the **Integration** > **Uncorrelate** command, you can uncorrelate items even if they were not deleted or their properties were not changed in the external application. See Uncorrelate Items.

**Changing the Design Basis of an Item**

It is not possible to directly change the design basis of an item; however, this can be achieved by first uncorrelating the item and then performing manual correlation between the required items. The uncorrelate https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 455/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

step makes the item on the drawing or in the active drawing stockpile available for manual correlation with a suitable item in the external application. Where the uncorrelate step is performed on an Update task on the To Do List, that task is permanently removed from the To Do List. The next time the document is retrieved, the To Do List is updated and a Create task is generated for the item, allowing you to correlate the item in the external application with a new item in Smart P&ID Engineering (by running the Create task) or with an existing Smart P&ID Engineering item (by performing manual correlation for the Create task).

Update tasks only update those mapped properties that are *different* in the two tools. When changing the design basis of an item that includes uncorrelation of an Update task followed by manual correlation to a different Smart P&ID Engineering item, it is recommended that you retrieve the item again and run any new Update tasks that are generated so as to synchronize the item’s properties.

**Correlate Pipe Runs with Streams**

This procedure explains how to correlate pipe runs in Smart P&ID Engineering with Aspen Basic Engineering streams. A single stream item in Aspen Basic Engineering normally maps to multiple pipe runs in Smart P&ID Engineering.

1. On the main menu, select **Integration** > **Correlate**.
2. In the drawing, select either an item that was retrieved and placed in the drawing or a previously correlated item. As you move your pointer over an item in the drawing that is already correlated, the item is highlighted. When you select a correlated item, it is added to the **Items** list on the **Correlate** dialog as a primary item. Then the application searches the database for all other items that are correlated to the same design basis item and adds them to the list as well.
3. On the **Correlate** dialog, select **Add**.
4. Select an item in the drawing that you want to correlate with the retrieved item. When the **Correlate** dialog opens, you can highlight and select only items that were retrieved or native P&ID items that are already correlated. Because retrieved items already have a correlation, a message appears to make sure that you want to change the existing correlation.

When you retrieve a document into Smart P&ID Engineering, each item that is created in a stockpile is automatically correlated to the design basis item that it came from.

**Remove the Correlation Between Pipe Runs and Streams**

1. Select **Integration** > Correlate to display the Correlate Dialog.
2. Select the item in the **Items** list whose correlation with the design basis you want to remove.

Opens the Correlate Dialog and allows you to review and edit the correlation between plant items and

design basis items.

**Correlate Dialog**

Allows you to review and edit the relationship between plant items and design basis items imported from external applications.

**Items**

Lists all the items associated with a single design basis item. Items in the active drawing are displayed in bold font style. A single item can be selected from the list, and when selected, the item is highlighted in the drawing.

**Select**

Allows you to review a different drawing item. Selecting this button clears the **Items** list. As you move your pointer over an item in the drawing that is already correlated, the item is highlighted. When you select on a correlated item, it is added to the **Items** list as a primary item. Then the application searches the database for all other items that are correlated to the same design basis item and adds them to the list as well. Right-clicking quits this command.

**Add**

Allows you to correlate an additional item to the same design basis item that the listed items are already correlated to. This command is available only when one or more items already appear in the **Items** list. As you move your pointer over an item in the drawing that has the same item type as the items in the list, the drawing item is highlighted. When you select on a highlighted item, it is correlated with the same design basis item, and it is added to the list. If you select an item that is already correlated to some other design basis item, a confirmation message appears. If you correlate a new item with a previously correlated item, both are associated with the same design basis item; however, the new item inherits the properties of the item that it is correlated to rather than the design basis item.

**Remove**

Deletes the selected item from the **Items** list and cancels its correlation with the design basis item.

**Uncorrelate Items**

The purpose of this procedure is to uncorrelate drawing items with their design basis items.

1. Select one or more items on the drawing.
2. On the main menu, select **Integration** > Uncorrelate to display the Uncorrelate Dialog.

In the **Design basis details** pane, beside the **ID**, **Item Tag** and **Item Type Name** columns, the software displays additional columns for each of the tools for which a design basis exists for the selected drawing items.

1. Select the check boxes for the items that you want to uncorrelate for each tool. To uncorrelate all of the items in a particular tool that have a design basis, select the check box in the header for that tool.

If an item does not have a design basis for a particular tool, the cell is read-only and it is not possible to select the check box.

After uncorrelating an item, any relevant tasks for that item on the **To Do List** dialog are removed.

**Uncorrelate Command**

Opens the Uncorrelate Dialog and allows you to review and remove the correlation between plant items and design basis items.

**Uncorrelate Dialog**

Allows you to review and remove relationships between plant items and design basis items retrieved from external applications.

**Design basis details**

Lists all the items selected on the drawing that have a design basis.

**ID**

Displays the SP_ID that uniquely defines the design basis of the item.

**Item Tag**

Displays the item tag as defined in Smart P&ID Engineering, if one exists.

**Item Type Name**

Displays the item type name, for example, **Equipment: Mechanical**.

For each tool for which a design basis exists for the selected items, the tool name appears in the additional table columns. Each cell in the column has a check box that is initially not selected. To remove an item’s design basis for a particular tool, select the check box in the individual cell corresponding to the item and the tool. To uncorrelate all of the items in a particular tool that have a design basis, select the check box in the header for that tool.

If an item does not have a design basis for a particular tool, the cell is read-only and it is not possible to select the check box.

**Using the To Do List**

The To Do List allows you to keep track of tasks required to keep P&IDs updated with information in the SmartPlant Foundation database. Specifically, this feature aids in retrieving data by providing a list of all the things that must be added, deleted, or modified to bring the drawing into agreement with the newest retrieved information.

A single To Do List is shared by all the users of a plant database. You can view the entire To Do List and see the tasks that have been completed and those that are pending. Some types of tasks have associated code and you can run them thereby causing the database or drawings to be modified.

From the To Do List, you can run, defer, or delete tasks, or specify tasks that you want the software to ignore in future retrievals. Additionally, you can view properties for each task in the To Do List and, if required, specify that certain task properties are ignored when the task is retrieved. The information that is available is specific to the type of task that is selected: Create tasks and Update tasks, for instance, but certain information is provided for all types. The available task types are: **Create**

Creates a new item in the active drawing or the plant stockpile

**Update**

Updates the selected properties of the specified item

**Delete**

Deletes the specified item from the plant

**Manual**

Creates and displays a reminder. You can decide when a manual task is complete and set the status accordingly.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, it is not possible to run Create or Delete tasks.

Each task in the To Do List has a status. Initially, the status is **Open** (no icon displayed). If you successfully run the task, the status changes to **Complete** . If you attempt to run a task, but the process is not completed successfully, the status is changed to **Error** . **Error** status occurs, for example, if you attempt to run an Update task assigned to a drawing that is not currently open. For a Create task where the task runs successfully, but the software has made changes to the item tag, the status is updated to **Completed** **with Warning** . See Example of ‘Completed with Warning’ Status. You can also postpone running a task and change its status to **Deferred** .

Smart P&ID Engineering retrieves equipment components and nozzles and generates corresponding Create tasks in the To Do List for them. The system allows you to automatically place the items in a https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 459/573

drawing when the To Do List task is executed. The items are placed attached to their parent equipment item, based on a spacing algorithm. You can adjust the location, post-placement, as necessary.

When the software creates an Update task in the To Do List, the units of measure used in properties are automatically converted to the defaults for the plant. The units of measure used for properties in Create tasks are converted to the plant defaults when the task is run.

By clicking the heading of columns on the To Do List, you sort the list by the values in that column.

You can change the order in which these columns appear in the **Task List** by right-clicking a column heading and choosing either **Shift Left** or **Shift Right** from the shortcut menu to move the column one place in either direction.

**To Do List Dialog**

Provides the ability to manage tasks that need to be run within a Smart P&ID Engineering database to keep the plant current with information in the SmartPlant Foundation database. This dialog opens when you select **Integration** > **To Do List** on the main menu bar. The commands associated with the To Do List are all on the **To Do List** toolbar.

**Open Drawing**

Opens the drawing associated with the selected task. If the drawing is not active, this command activates it.

Any currently-open drawings remain open. This command is available when a drawing-specific task is selected and the drawing is not currently open or active. If multiple tasks are selected, this command is available only if they are assigned to the same drawing. You can assign or reassign a **Create** task, but **Update** and **Delete** tasks that are already assigned to a drawing cannot be reassigned.

**Zoom In**

Centers and zooms in on the drawing items associated with the selected tasks in the Drawing view. You select the tasks from the list. This command allows you to visually inspect the referenced objects in the context of the surrounding drawing and is available when the selected task is associated with graphics and the drawing that contains the object is open and active. If multiple tasks are selected, this command is available only if each of the tasks meets these criteria.

**New Manual Task**

Displays the** Task Properties** dialog, and allows you to manually create a new task.

**Properties**

Displays the** Task Properties **dialog for the selected task. This dialog shows the detailed properties of the task. This command is available only when a single task is selected.

**Assign Drawing**

Creates an association between the selected task and a particular drawing. The **Assign Drawing** dialog opens and lists the available drawings. This command is available when you select manually added tasks or https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 468/573

tasks resulting from the **Create** command. If multiple tasks are selected, this command is available only if each of the tasks meets these criteria.

**Create in Drawing**

When a Create task is run, the toggle state of this button determines where the item is created. If this button is *not* depressed (the default setting), the item created by running the selected task is sent to the Active Drawing stockpile. If the button is depressed, the item created is placed on the active drawing. If the catalog item of the task is an assembly, the item created can only be sent to the Active Drawing stockpile, and therefore in this case the toggle state of the button is ignored.

**Run**

Runs the task that you select from the list. This command is available when an executable task is selected, the associated drawing is open and active, and the status of the selected task is **Open** or **Error**. This command is not available for manually created tasks; in other words, the command is only available for tasks generated automatically by integration and importing data. If multiple tasks are selected, this command is available only if each of the tasks meets these criteria.

When a task runs, the status of the task and the **Run Date** and **Run By** properties are updated. If the task runs successfully, the status is updated to **Completed** . If there is a problem, the status is updated to **Error** . For a Create task where the task runs successfully, but the software has made changes to the item tag, the status is updated to **Completed with Warning** . See Example of ’Completed

with Warning’ Status. When the status is **Error** or **Completed with Warning**, a timestamp and error message are added to the **Notes** area on the **General** tab of the **Task Properties** dialog.

**Defer**

Toggles the status of the selected tasks between **Open** and **Deferred** . This command is available only when the selected tasks have **Open**, **Error** , or **Deferred** status.

**Delete**

Deletes the selected task from the **To Do List**. This command is available only when one or more tasks are selected. A confirmation dialog appears to verify deletion of the selected task or tasks.

**Ignore**

Allows you to specify the selected task from the To Do List as an ignored task. This command is available only when one or more tasks are selected. When you invoke this command, the software moves all the selected tasks to the ignored tasks list. An ignored task is skipped for all subsequent retrieve operations. To make a task available for running again the next time you retrieve data, you must delete that task from the ignored tasks list.

**Correlate**

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Allows you to correlate tasks manually when a retrieved item tag does not match the defined correlation criteria. This command is available only when a Create task is selected. To correlate an item, you select a suitable item on the drawing sheet or in the **Engineering Data Editor**. After correlation, the Create task changes to an Update task and the software removes any properties on the task that have the same values as those of the item selected on the drawing sheet.

Correlation is allowed under the following conditions:

The selected item cannot have an existing design basis for the same tool from which the item was published.

The selected item must be of the same item type as the item for which the Create task applies.

If a catalog item exists for the selected item, its catalog item type must be the same as the catalog item type defined for the Create task.

**Uncorrelate**

Allows you to uncorrelate tasks related to items on the drawing sheet or in the **Engineering Data Editor**.

This command is available only when Update or Delete tasks are selected. After uncorrelating tasks, the items will no longer be correlated with the tool from which those tasks were retrieved. The tasks are permanently removed from the To Do List and do not appear on the deleted tasks list. The next time the document is retrieved, the To Do List is updated.

**View Deleted Tasks**

Toggles the view between the To Do List and the deleted tasks list. To completely delete tasks, you select them from the deleted tasks list and select **Delete**

.

**View Ignored Tasks**

Toggles the view between the To Do List and the ignored tasks list. To make tasks available for running again the next time you retrieve data, you select them from the ignored tasks list and select **Delete**

.

**Report**

Opens Microsoft Excel and runs a report on the contents of the **To Do List**. This command is only available from the **To Do List** toolbar, but the report template, called To Do List.xls, produces reports much the same way other reports are produced.

**Filter / Sort Tasks**

Opens a dialog that allows you to filter or sort the list of tasks by the headings in the To Do List. This is useful if, for example, you want to filter or sort the tasks to run tasks of one type only, such as **Create** tasks.

**Refresh**

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Updates the information that is displayed in the **To Do List**. Because only one **To Do List** is generated per plant, multiple users can be working in the **To Do List** at the same time, and so the information can change at any time. You can use the **Refresh** command to stay up-to-date.

**Group Related Tasks**

When this button is depressed, selecting the column header not only sorts the tasks based on the selected sort key but also groups the related tasks. If the **Group Related Items** button is not depressed, then selecting the column header only sorts the tasks based on the selected column sort key.

**Search box**

Allows you to display tasks using search-as-you-type for all data columns. During a search operation, the Search box is highlighted with a red border. If a filter is already applied on the To Do List, the search is performed on the filtered view. Only tasks for which data matches the search string are displayed; the rest of the tasks are hidden. The total number of displayed tasks is shown in the To Do List status area at the bottom. Search strings are *not* case-sensitive and cells in the Task List that include matching data are highlighted:

To clear the search string, select

beside the Search box.

**Task List**

Populates automatically when you retrieve a document. This list provides information about each task, including, for example, the status of the task, the destination drawing, the name of the task, a description of the task, and so forth. By selecting the heading of any of these columns, you sort the list by the values in that column. You can change the order in which these columns appear in the **Task List** by right-clicking a column heading and choosing either **Shift Left** or **Shift Right** on the shortcut menu to move the column one place in either direction. Double-clicking a task opens the **Task Properties** dialog for that task.

The **Task Assignment** column value is assigned on the **General** tab of the **Properties** dialog for the task and is intended for filtering To Do List tasks.

**Assign Drawing Dialog**

Allows you to associate a task in the **To Do List** with a drawing assigned to the active plant structure.

Create tasks are not initially associated with a drawing; you can assign Create or Manual tasks using this dialog. This dialog opens when you select **Assign Drawing**

on the **To Do List** dialog.

**Clear**

Removes the association between the selected task and a drawing.

**Drawings**

Lists all the drawings associated with the active plant. Select the drawing that you want to associate with the tasks you selected on the **To Do List** dialog. When you select a drawing and select **OK**, the selected tasks https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 471/573

**Transferring Smart P&ID Engineering Piping Data**

Piping data defined in Smart P&ID Engineering can be transferred to PDS® using the Smart P&ID

Engineering to PDS Piping Data Transfer capability. The ability to transfer PDS P&ID data to PDS 3D is documented in the PDS documentation and is therefore not covered here.

**Piping System Schematic and Physical Representations**

Although both Smart P&ID Engineering and PDS describe the same plant, a one-to-one correspondence between the components in the two models does not always exist. Smart P&ID Engineering to PDS piping data transfer is essentially the transfer of data from the Smart P&ID Engineering segment table to the PDS

piping segment table, pdtable_12_xx.

The conceptual definition of a segment is the same in both applications, however that does not mean that there is a one-to-one correspondence between these two tables. For example, the number of segments is not the same, even if the Smart P&ID Engineering and PDS piping model exactly match from a design point of view. This situation is caused by the different drafting practices of Smart P&ID Engineering and PDS. For example, drains are shown as macro symbols on the Smart P&ID Engineering drawing. However, drains are branch segments in the PDS model. Also, process connections to instruments are recorded as instrument signal lines in the Smart P&ID Engineering database, but on the PDS side, process connections are piping segments.

Due to these differences, the data transfer process requires establishing a logical link between the corresponding segments. This linkage can either be in the form of interactive input from the PDS designer, who can choose a piping segment in a drawing by selecting it, or be a combination of attributes defined as unique criteria in the SPTransferOpt file. For more information on attribute mapping, see Mapping Attributes.

**Data Transfer in the Real World**

When you model a new line in PDS, use the **Data from P&ID** option, and then select a Smart P&ID

Engineering segment. By doing this, you are establishing the logical link. After this link is established, future data transfers can be fully automated.

However, as with most plants, there is a time when Smart P&ID Engineering drafting and PDS modeling continues in parallel. The P&IDs are changing while piping modeling continues in PDS. When the designer models a particular pipeline, the equivalent Smart P&ID Engineering segments might not yet exist in the Smart P&ID Engineering database, creating a significant amount of piping that does not have the associative link between Smart P&ID Engineering and PDS. This is just one example of how creating and updating links is an ongoing process rather than a one-time effort. For more information about maintaining

links between Smart P&ID Engineering and PDS, see Creating and Maintaining Links.

time savings as opposed to manually checking P&ID against PDS piping data. If you would like to use this feature but need help, Intergraph Process, Power & Marine offers consulting services to guide you. For more information, see the **Customer Support** links on the **About Smart P&ID Engineering** dialog.

The key factor in these benefits is creating and maintaining links between the Smart P&ID Engineering and the PDS segments. The following flowchart shows the workflow for resolving data transfer discrepancies during the plant design.

**PDS Design Considerations**

Use the **Data from P&ID** command often while routing new piping in PDS.

When creating a pipeline by copying existing piping, use the **Revise Attribute** > **Update from P&ID**

command to load the data from Smart P&ID Engineering.

When creating a branch using an existing segment or pipe, check whether the branch is shown in Smart P&ID Engineering. If it is shown, then use the **Revise Attribute** > **Update from P&ID**

command to load the data from Smart P&ID Engineering.

Verify that the **Partial P&ID Data Transfer** option at the end of the **Segment Attribute** list is selected.

You can change this value by using the **Revise Attribute** command. Default transfer modes are set https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 490/573

such that during a partial transfer all diameter- independent properties are transferred. This option allows the drain to share the line sequence number, pressure, temperature, and so forth, with the header and still have a different diameter and line number label. This action is controlled in the SPMap.mdb file.

Instrument connections or drains on equipment with no equivalent segment in Smart P&ID

Engineering, can be excluded from future comparison reports. Simply select the **Inhibit Future** **Transfer** option when you review a comparison report error related to these segments.

**Synchronizing P&ID and Piping Data**

Synchronizing Smart P&ID Engineering and PDS piping data should be done only a few times during plant design. The best times to synchronize are when the majority of the P&IDs are completed, revised, or issued. This synchronization involves running a P&ID Segment Data Comparison Report and then resolving any discrepancies and helps to build the association between Smart P&ID Engineering and PDS that is then maintained throughout the plant lifetime.

This synchronization involves running a P&ID Segment Data Comparison Report and then resolving any discrepancies, and is outlined in the flowchart above.

**Running a Segment Data Comparison Report**

Running a Segment Data Comparison Report is the starting point on the flowchart. The results of this report depend on two key factors:

The matching criteria defined in the SPTransferOpt file in the plant directory. For more information,

see Map an Ignored Attribute or Map an Unmapped Attribute.

The **Compare Segment with Node Numbers/Compare All Segments** setting.

While running this report, the **Compare All Segments** setting should be used, and matching criteria should be node numbers.

Based on the availability of P&IDs during the initial piping design stage, the number of discrepancies can be very high on the first run. Our experience shows that a piping designer, who has good knowledge of the piping involved and the related P&ID, takes approximately two to four minutes to resolve a discrepancy.

Successive uses of this procedure should reduce the numbers of discrepancies. If plant design resources or time do not allow resolving all discrepancies, then you should consider alternative methods to running the Segment Data Comparison Report.

One alternative is to change the matching criteria. Matching criteria directs the software to establish associations between Smart P&ID Engineering and PDS piping segments based on the value of the attributes specified. For example, the default criteria of node numbers means that node numbers for a PDS

piping segment must match with a P&ID segment. If the Smart P&ID Engineering to PDS Piping Data Transfer has not been done for a piping segment, then no node number is defined for that segment. This situation generates a **Node Numbers Undefined only** discrepancy. If the majority of the piping falls under https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 491/573

this category, then the number of discrepancies can be very high. To reduce this number, change the matching criteria to something other than node numbers. Typically, any of the individual properties of a line number label such as NPD, line sequence number, insulation purpose, and so forth, can be used. It is better to use as many properties as possible so that they form a unique combination. All properties specified as matching criteria should have some value assigned to them on both sides.

Another alternative to running the comparison report is to specify segment search criteria. This method can be used if all instrument connections on equipment or drain lines not shown on the P&ID contain common attributes such as different fluid codes or prefixes to line sequence numbers, and so forth.

Another possibility is to use a range of diameters so that small diameter segments can be eliminated.

**Establish a Smart P&ID Engineering/PDS Link**

When setting up data transfer for multiple plants, if the PDS 3D and Smart P&ID Engineering plants have the same set of properties and the same intended mapping, then you can copy the SPMap.mdb file from one plant to another. The Attribute Mapper always verifies that the Smart P&ID Engineering site in the .mdb file is the same as the map for the selected PDS project. However, if you are not sure if the plants have the same set of properties, we recommend that you copy the delivered SPMap.mdb file from the PDSHELL\pid\ folder.

For a project where data transfer was set up to work with an earlier version of Smart P&ID Engineering, some attribute mappings have changed. You can use either the new SPMap.mdb file delivered in the PDSHELL\pid\ folder or follow the procedure mentioned for CR32693 in the PDS README file. Even if you are going to work with the default attribute mapping, you must start SmartPlant Attribute Mapper at least once. If necessary, you can back up the updated SPMap.mdb file, delete the changes, and copy a fresh SPMap.mdb to go through the mapping process again.

1. Copy \WIN32APP\INGR\PDSHELL\pid\SPMap.mdb and SPTransferOpt to the PDS project directory.

For projects created with version 6.4.1 or later, these files are copied automatically from the PDSHELL\pid folder at the time of project creation.

1. Go to **Start** > **Programs** > **PD_Shell** > **SP PID to PDS 3D** to display a list of available PDS projects.

The software reads the list of PDS projects from the PDS proj_file.

The Attribute Mapper does not honor any other variables defined in the pds.cmd file, such as RIS parameter file locations, and so forth.

1. Double-click the PDS project to use with Smart P&ID Engineering and locate the SmartPlantV4.ini file.

The SmartPlant Migrator for P&ID utility opens and shows the PDS attributes for the selected project.

The location of the SmartPlantV4.ini file must be specified using a complete UNC path. If path to this .ini file is mapped on a network drive and the mapped network drive path is used to locate it, this results in errors.

After a relationship between attributes is established, the SmartPlant Attribute Mapper opens. The link between the Smart P&ID Engineering plant and the PDS 3D project is established and updated automatically in the SPMap.mdb file. For the attribute mapper to run properly, the following path to Smart Engineering Manager must be added to the system PATH environment variable:

“..\..\SmartPlant\Engineering Manager\bin”

Attribute.

**Revising Linked Models**

**Modification in Smart P&ID Engineering**

The Smart P&ID Engineering software generates node numbers during consistency checking. If existing segments on the P&ID are modified, then those node numbers might also be modified. This situation occurs when placing either a branch on an existing segment or a segment break, causing the link between Smart P&ID Engineering and PDS to become outdated. In most cases, changes in Smart P&ID Engineering mean changes in the piping model. Resolving this type of discrepancy improves the integrity of the design data.

**Modification of a PDS Model**

Physical modification of segments with PDS commands such as **Move Piping**, **Move Vertex**, **Move** **Pipeline End**, and so forth, do not affect Smart P&ID Engineering to PDS Piping Data Transfer. All branch component placement commands break the segments and potentially lose links with Smart P&ID

Engineering. While placing drain connections, which are not shown on P&IDs, it is better to use the **Revise** **Attributes** > **Load from P&ID** command on the header segment before placing the drain connection or branch components. Then all three segments are linked with the proper segment in Smart P&ID

Engineering. After creating the branch drain segment, make sure that the **P&ID to Piping Transfer** mode attribute is set to **Partial** for the branch segment. Transfers done after placing a drain require that you use the **Revise Attribute** command three times.

**Mapping Attributes**

Smart P&ID Engineering to Piping Data Transfer relies on an attribute map stored in a Microsoft Access database located in the PDS project folder. This map database file is named SPMap.mdb, and contains information about the Smart Plant P&ID site server and plant. The Attribute Mapper utility is used to manipulate this map database. The Attribute Mapper is started from a shortcut provided in the PD_Shell program group named **SP PID to PDS 3D**.

The Attribute Mapper utility maps, un-maps, or ignores attributes between PDS 3D and Smart P&ID

Engineering. The Attribute Mapper interface is similar to Windows Explorer in that it displays a tree view on the left side and list view on the right side. Attributes for piping segment, piping component, and instrument tables from the PDS 3D design database are available to map with corresponding Smart P&ID Engineering tables, specifically the PipeRun, PipingComp and Instrument tables.

The tree view divides attributes into four categories based on map status: **Mapped**, **Unmapped**, **Ignored**, and **All**. For Smart P&ID Engineering to PDS 3D data transfer, the **Ignored** map status is the same as the **Unmapped** status.

**The Default Map**

PDS software includes a default map in the PDSHELL\pid folder. This map has a set of attributes that are pre-mapped with known Smart P&ID Engineering properties. When you create a new project using PDS

software, this map is copied to the project folder. For older projects, the SPMap.mdb file should be manually copied from the PDSHELL\pid folder into the 3D project folder.

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The default map is functionally equivalent to the pid_to_piping file used for PDS 2D to 3D data transfer with a few exceptions. For example, it is not necessary to map units because of the way units of measure information is stored. This applies to attributes like pressure and temperature. The SPTransferOpt file includes the three options that you can find at the bottom of the pid_to_piping file. For PDS 2D to PDS

3D data transfer, the mapper specifies the database attributes that are considered in order to perform the data transfer. By default, for PDS 2D transfer the mapper is mapping NodeA (piping attribute 67) and NodeB

(piping attribute 68). For Smart P&ID Engineering to PDS 3D data transfer, because there are no node numbers in Smart P&ID Engineering, the mapper is mapping piping attribute sppid_piperun_guid (piping attribute 78).

**Select Lists**

Select-listed Smart P&ID Engineering properties are transferred based on their text value instead of number. The Attribute Mapper creates a map of PDS codelist entries for every Smart P&ID Engineering select list used in the mapped properties.

For example, fluid code “P” is represented by the PDS 3D codelist entry 25 and by entry 35 in the Smart P&ID Engineering select list. When the fluid code property is transferred, the property value changes from 35 in the Smart P&ID Engineering database to attribute value 25 in the PDS Database. This functionality has removed the requirement of maintaining the same select list and codelist values in Smart P&ID

Engineering and PDS 3D.

**Map an Ignored Attribute**

This procedure includes only the major steps involved in mapping an attribute. Refer to PDS Online Help or documentation for detailed instructions.

1. Open the **SmartPlant Migrator for P&ID** utility. See Establish a Smart P&ID Engineering/PDS Link.
2. Select the **Ignored** category.
3. Select the table in the tree view.
4. Select a PDS attribute in the list view.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **Partial** are transferred when you use the **Partial Data Transfer** toggle within PDS.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **Default** receive the default value, which you enter in the **Default** box, during partial data transfer.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **No Default** do not get a default value and do not get transferred during partial data transfer.

All **Mapped** properties are transferred during complete data transfer.

**Map an Unmapped Attribute**

This procedure includes only the major steps involved in mapping an attribute. Refer to PDS Online Help or documentation for detailed instructions.

1. Open the **SmartPlant Migrator for P&ID** utility. See Establish a Smart P&ID Engineering/PDS Link.
2. Expand the **Unmapped** category.
3. Select the table in the tree view.
4. Select a PDS attribute in the list view.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **Partial** are transferred when you use the **Partial Data Transfer** toggle within PDS.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **Default** receive the default value, which you enter in the **Default** box, during partial data transfer.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **No Default** do not get a default value and do not get transferred during partial data transfer.

All **Mapped** properties are transferred during complete data transfer.

**Segment Data Comparison Report**

The software compares segment data on the basis of the matching criteria defined in the SPTransferOpt correlation table. If no matching criteria are defined, the software compares segment data on the basis of the Smart P&ID Engineering node numbers that are common to both the Smart P&ID Engineering database and the PDS database, or the node numbers and line number labels, depending on what you specify using the available options.

The piping segment data is also compared on the basis of the **Complete** or **Partial** data transfer options.

If a match is found, each attribute value, as specified in the SPMap.mdb correlation table and filtered for either complete or partial data transfer, is compared with the corresponding property value in the Smart P&ID Engineering database. For any pair of corresponding attribute values that differ, the discrepancy is reported in the Segment Data Comparison Report.

This report includes a comparison of the flow direction for the PDS piping segment and the Smart P&ID

Engineering segment by using the P&ID node numbers. If no corresponding segment is found in the Smart P&ID Engineering database for a PDS piping segment with valid matching criteria, an error is reported.

If the search mode is set to **END** in the SPTransferOpt file, the software compares all of the Smart P&ID

Engineering segments that have matching search criteria to the applicable PDS piping segment and uses the Smart P&ID Engineering segment that best matches the PDS piping segment for the comparison.

Otherwise, the search mode is **FIRST**, and comparison is made with the first P&ID segment that has matching criteria.

The Segment Data Comparison Report also includes line sequence numbers.

Because the data comparisons are performed on the basis of the PDS piping segments, not all segments in the Smart P&ID Engineering database are checked for matches.

The software creates the following files in the same directory location as the processed model file: A report file named *model_number*.pc ( *model_number* is the number of the model that is extracted from the PDS Project Database).

A non-printable, sorted file named *model_number*.pci (this file is used by the **Review P&ID**

**Comparison Report** command).

A non-printable, sorted file named *model_number*.pca (this file is used by the **P&ID Data** **Comparison**, **Update Model**, **Segment Data Comparison Report**, and **Review P&ID Comparison** **Report** commands for the approval of data discrepancies. The .pca file is initially created when you approve a discrepancy, and the file is appended to with each additional approval).

You can format the title page and the heading for each page of the Segment Data Comparison Report using the \win32app\ingr\pddesign\sample\pid_cmprpt.fmt format file. The remainder of the report is in the following format:

< *line number*> < *P&ID Node Numbers*> < *P&ID Drawing Number*> **Attribute**

**Choosing Data Transfer Options**

**Matching Criteria**

PDS uses matching criteria to generate the Segment Data Comparison report. In order to compare segment records, the records must first be matched or correlated. Matching criteria defines the correlating attribute in the PDS 3D database. The default attribute map reserves the pid_index_no attribute for matching criteria.

This fact means that the Segment Data Comparison report compares piping segment attributes from the PDS and Smart P&ID Engineering databases if the pid_index_no in the PDS database matches the unique sp_id in the Smart P&ID Engineering database.

**Smart P&ID Engineering**

Consider the following points when planning for data transfer from a Smart P&ID Engineering plant to a PDS 3D project.

**Symbol Properties** — By default, PDS searches the piping specification based on predefined aabbcc codes. Smart P&ID Engineering symbols must have a property mapped to the aabbcc_code attribute in the PDS database. The delivered Smart P&ID Engineering piping component symbols have a property called aabbcc_code, which can be viewed and edited in Catalog Manager. Any new symbols must have this value defined, either at symbol creation or later.

**Naming Conventions** — PDS 3D is not capable of handling spaces in the path names to any files.

Therefore, this PDS restriction also applies to P&IDs. While creating units and drawings in the Smart P&ID Engineering site, take care to avoid creating paths with spaces.

**Symbology** — Smart P&ID Engineering stores drawings in a format other than IGDS (MicroStation).

These drawings are converted to IGDS format to display in PDS. By default, PDS and MicroStation use a black background, while Smart P&ID Engineering uses a white background. When converted to IGDS format, this difference can make some Smart P&ID Engineering graphics barely visible on the black background. Consideration should be given to this fact while defining symbology within Smart P&ID Engineering plants. Smart P&ID Engineering symbology is defined in Options Manager.

Two methods exist to manipulate the display so that all of the graphics are clearly visible in their new format:

**Method 1**: Turn off the **Reference File** > **Use Color Table** setting under **User** > **User** **Preferences** > **Reference File** in PDS. This action displays the drawing using the active color scheme for the PDS model, rather than honoring the colors from Smart P&ID Engineering.

**Method 2**: Change the **Background** color of the piping model to a light color by using **Settings**

> Colors.
> 

**Additional Attributes** — If properties added to the Smart P&ID Engineering database need to be transferred to PDS, be careful to match attribute type and length on either side. The maximum string length supported by RIS / PDS 3D is 240 characters. If a property has an associated select list in https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 498/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Smart P&ID Engineering, then it should have a corresponding codelist in 3D. You must run the Attribute Mapper to map new properties if you want the data to transfer.

**Codelists and Select Lists** — Even though having the same number and sequence for entries within a codelist or select list is not required, for any mapped attributes, the PDS 3D codelist should have all entries from the Smart P&ID Engineering select list. If a new text entry is added to a Smart P&ID

Engineering select list, the same text entry should be created in the corresponding PDS 3D codelist.

The Attribute Mapper must be run after any such change.

**Layers and Drawing Filters** — PDS uses the concept of layers in a piping design to display selected elements of a drawing; whereas, Smart P&ID Engineering uses drawing filters. The ExportLayer.xlsx file defines how the layers in PDS are related to the different drawing objects. The location of this Excel file is defined in Options Manager.

You can assign layer alphanumeric names to item types in order to assure that graphics appear in the designated layers in PDS. Items are named according to filters, which are defined in Filter Manager.

For more information, see the topics dealing with layers in the Smart P&ID Engineering Online Help.

**PDS 3D**

**Codelists** — A PDS 3D codelist can be a super set of a Smart P&ID Engineering select list. This means that a PDS code list can have extra entries not contained in the Smart P&ID Engineering select list because the data transfer works one way; that is, from Smart P&ID Engineering to PDS 3D.

**User Attributes** — Attributes can be created in PDS 3D independent of the Smart P&ID Engineering plant if data transfer is not required. If transfer is required, care should be taken when adding attributes. A Smart P&ID Engineering database does not distinguish between short and long integers.

Any new integer property that is added to such a database must be created as a long integer in the PDS database.

**Load from P&ID Options**

Updates the active segment data based on information defined in the Smart P&ID Engineering. The system verifies the temperature and pressure service limits when loading segment data from the Smart P&ID

Engineering database into an existing piping segment for which data was previously transferred.

**Complete Data Transfer Option**

Transfers all mapped attributes from the selected Smart P&ID Engineering segment into the active PDS

segment data. Attributes that are transferred are shown in yellow. Attributes that are not mapped are shown in black.

**Partial Data Transfer Option**

Transfers those mapped attributes that have the **Partial** option chosen during attribute mapping, from the selected Smart P&ID Engineering segment into active PDS segment data. Attributes that are transferred are shown in blue.

**Equipment and Nozzle Numbers Option**

Updates the active segment data from the Smart P&ID Engineering using the segment data attached to the specified Equipment/Nozzle ID.

**Name from P&ID Option**

Selects the piping or instrument component that you want to place by identifying a component in the Smart P&ID Engineering. If the selected instrument has a tag number that does not exist in the Piping Job Specification, the system displays the **Instrument Placement** dialog with both **Data From Reference** **Database** and **Data From User** options. Select the **Data from User** option, select the shape that you want, and enter the dimensions that are required. This procedure allows the tag number and the properties that were mapped in the attribute map to transfer from the Smart P&ID Engineering database to the PDS

database.

This mechanism also applies to piping specialties.

**Graphical P&ID Setup Command**

This command searches, selects, and displays the Smart P&ID Engineering within the PDS piping design environment. This display enables the graphical transfer of piping segment data by snapping to graphics in the active P&ID. You can also specify a component name for placement by selecting a component in the P&ID.

For data transfer purposes, only one P&ID can be active. You can select a P&ID to display from the list of P&IDs extracted from the Smart P&ID Engineering database. The list of P&IDs is limited to P&IDs for the active unit number in the PDS piping model, or if the active unit number is undefined, then all P&IDs from the Smart P&ID Engineering database are listed in alphanumeric order by drawing number.

The **Graphical P&ID Setup** command checks for the existence of Smart P&ID Engineering data in the PDS

project. If P&ID data is found, then PDS 2D starts the old software component to allow data transfer from P&ID. If the project is PDS 3D only, then the data transfer from Smart P&ID Engineering to PDS 3D starts.

You can use the following options to select the P&ID to display.

**P&ID Conversion Option**

Launches Smart P&ID Engineering automation to convert the selected P&ID from its native format to IGDS

format. The converted drawing is placed in a temporary folder. The drawing is closed automatically upon exiting the design session.

**Units of Measure Option**

Converts SI units in Smart P&ID Engineering using unit-related codelists from the Standard Note library in PDS. Smart P&ID Engineering stores all properties with a unit of measure in SI units. For example, length is stored in meters regardless of your plant settings. The software then checks another property that determines how you want length values to appear. When a property represents a quantity based on units https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 500/573

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

(for example, pressure, temperature, and so forth) data transfer looks at the active segment data, or type 63

settings, to determine the unit of measure to use. The SI value stored in the database is then converted using unit- related code lists from the Standard Note library.

**Code-listed Attributes Option**

Uses a codelist map to translate the codelisted attributes. The Attribute Mapper stores mapping of codelist numbers such that their text values match. Data transfer uses this codelist map to translate the codelisted attributes from the database to the PDS database.

If the Smart P&ID Engineering database participates in Workshare environment, then the P&ID list is a combination of the P&IDs owned and subscribed to (that is, published by remote location) by the site.

Use the LocalModelItemLookupTable.sql utility if your connected Workshare satellite experiences performance problems when transferring piping data from Smart P&ID Engineering to PDS. This script converts a satellite database view (namely, the T_ModelItemLookup) that references a host table into a local table, allowing the data transfer to proceed without using a DBLink. Smart P&ID Engineering uses the DBLink to fetch unique Long IDs from the Host when running from a connected Workshare satellite. If the performance of opening the PID file in PDS is an issue or if maintaining the correlation between Smart P&ID Engineering and PDS after the merge is not an issue, then you can run this script to change the lookup for the Long ID from a view to the host to a local query. This utility is delivered as an SQL script to the ..\SmartPlant\P&ID Workstation\bin folder and can be executed using any Oracle user interface, such as SQLPlus. Do not use this script if the transferred PDS data will be merged back into a host PDS database because the Long IDs will not be unique at the host.

Because Smart P&ID Engineering databases are unit-dependent and PDS databases are design area-dependent, one PDS piping design area can include data from different Smart P&ID Engineering units. Consequently, you must specify the correct unit number in the active segment data prior to requesting a list of P&IDs from a Smart P&ID Engineering database.

**Select P&ID by Line ID Command**

This command specifies a line ID by identifying piping in the PDS piping model or by accepting the active line ID. The system determines the Smart P&ID Engineering (or list of P&IDs) from the line ID. It searches the Segment Table of the Smart P&ID Engineering database using the system-unique number for the drawing and the line ID for the segment. All P&ID segments belonging to the specified line ID are highlighted.

**Select P&ID Drawing by Nozzle Command**

This command specifies an equipment number and nozzle number by locating a component connected to a nozzle, by typing in an equipment number and nozzle number, or by placing a data point over a nozzle in a model. The system determines the Smart P&ID Engineering from the equipment number and nozzle https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 501/573

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

number and data in the Smart P&ID Engineering database. All P&ID segments that have the same line ID

as the segment connected to the active nozzle are highlighted.

Currently, only the first segment coming off the nozzle is highlighted, not the entire line.

**Review P&ID Drawing Details Command**

Displays information about a selected Smart P&ID Engineering in the active unit.

**P&ID Drawing Display Categories Command**

Displays Smart P&ID Engineering display categories. Categories that are currently displayed are highlighted on this dialog. Selecting a category toggles its setting. P&ID controls display and symbology through the use of drawing filters. The P&ID graphics in the converted IGDS format are not organized into familiar categories such as piping, equipment, or instruments, instead the software displays MicroStation levels 1

through 63 as Smart P&ID Engineering drawing filters. Some of the categories are turned off automatically to hide blank label enclosures and inactive heat tracing graphics.

**Restore View of Piping Model Command**

Restores the PDS 3D model view in the window where the Smart P&ID Engineering is currently displayed.

**Disable Display of P&ID Drawing Command**

Closes the currently displayed Smart P&ID Engineering and restores the PDS 3D model view.

**Named Component Existence Report Command**

Compares the existence of user-specified named components between the PDS and the Smart P&ID

Engineering databases in batch mode on the basis of a user-defined list of lines and then generates a report of the results.

If a PDS 2D P&ID database exists, then it is used with the PDS model as the basis for comparison. If it does not exist, then the Smart P&ID Engineering database is used as the basis for comparison. As part of the report, the software includes the database that the comparison was based on. The comparison does not make use of either the P&ID drawing or the PDS piping model. Therefore, the order of components is not considered in the report.

A user-defined list, design area, or model is used to define those items that are included in the report. The user-defined list must have one line ID per line. Whether you create a list or use a design area or model, the list of line IDs used to perform the comparison is included in the report.

The comparison considers the entire pipe run in both the Smart P&ID Engineering database and the PDS

database. If a line ID is used in multiple Smart P&ID Engineering or is included in multiple PDS models, the complete definition of all P&IDs or models is included in the report regardless of the line-ID option that is selected.

The following items are included in the comparison report:

The named components in the piping design database are included and are compared on the basis of the following data:

Tagged piping commodities are compared on the basis of their piping component number Piping specialties are compared on the basis of their piping component number Inline instruments are compared on the basis of their instrument component number Tagged piping commodities in the Smart P&ID Engineering database that have the following data are included:

The **Commodity Code** flag is set to by system or by user and the commodity code is defined The **Piping Component Number** is defined

Piping specialties in the Smart P&ID Engineering database are determined by those piping components that have the following data:

The **Commodity Code** flag is set by the user or is blank

The **Piping Component Number** is defined

Instruments in the Smart P&ID Engineering database are determined by the following criterion: Only those instruments that are applicable to the PDS 3D model, such as those requiring dimension definition in the RDB, as determined by an Instrument Correlation List The Instrument Correlation List, which is necessary to define the applicable instruments for transfer, is a user-defined ASCII file in the project folder and is named pid_instrument. With this list you can specify the inclusion or exclusion of Smart P&ID Engineering instruments on the basis of their aabb or aabbcc codes.

You can include or exclude groups of instruments on the basis of the aabb code for that instrument by using the appropriate keyword, either **Include** or **Exclude**, followed by the aabb code. You can specify exceptions to the aabb codes on the basis of specific aabbcc codes so that you can exclude from an **Include** group, or you can add those entries to an **Exclude** group by adding the exceptions under the line containing the **Include** or **Exclude** statement.

The **!** character signifies a comment line in this ASCII file.

The following text represents the default Instrument Correlation List that defines the Smart P&ID

Engineering instruments that are applicable to the PDS 3D model. In this example, the aabb code represents a substring search of the aabbcc code.

**MapPathName** is the complete UNC path to the Smart P&ID Engineering plant SPMap.mdb file located in the PDS project directory

**IsThreeD** has to be selected

**SPSiteNode** is the UNC path to the SmartPlantV4.ini file

**SPProjectName** is the Smart P&ID Engineering plant name

Save changes made to the SPMap.mdb file, and run the **SP PID to PDS 3D** command again.

If a client computer experiences problems connecting to the project, remove the Intergraph SmartPlant Attribute Mapper and Smart P&ID Engineering Automation components using **Add/Remove** **Programs**. Restart the computer and reinstall PD_Shell and Smart P&ID Engineering Integration Tools using the silent installation. Be aware that for PDS users to set up the attribute map and perform data transfer, they must have permission to access the Smart P&ID Engineering server through Smart Engineering Manager.

**Display**

Start PD_Shell, and go to piping. Inside the PDS piping model but before using the **Graphical P&ID Setup** command, select one of the two methods below so that all of the P&ID items are clearly visible in order to display properly the converted P&ID within PDS:

**Method 1**: Turn off the **Reference File** > **Use Color Table** setting under **User** > **User Preferences** > **Reference File**. This action displays the drawing using the active color scheme for the PDS model, rather than honoring the colors from Smart P&ID Engineering.

**Method 2**: Change the **Background** color of the piping model to a lighter color by using **Settings** > **Colors**.

**Display by Unit Filter**

Run the **Graphical P&ID Setup** command as with PDS 2D, unless the unit is simply a filter. If not specified, all plant P&IDs are shown. Note that the P&ID Drawing Name is what you see on the data transfer dialogs, not the drawing number.

**Temperature/Pressure Units**

Select lines for pipe run and component data for the **Name from P&ID** option. For pipe run data, four sets of temperature/pressure values with units must be set in the Smart P&ID Engineering or you will receive an error about temperature/pressure limits. You can choose the **No Minimum T-P Data for Service Limits** **Verification** option in the PDS project data manager to prevent that error. When using this option, the lower range of the temperature/pressure values is not checked, thus allowing undefined values in PDS: -9999.

**Removing Software from a Silent Installation Configuration**

For a silent installation, when you accept the **Smart P&ID Engineering Integration Tools** option on the PDS component loader dialog, the following components are installed and the following folders created: Intergraph SmartPlant Attribute Mapper

Intergraph Smart P&ID Engineering Automation, including

..\Common Files\Intergraph\RAD (used by Smart P&ID Engineering and SmartSketch)

..\Common Files\Intergraph Shared\SmartPlant

..\SmartPlant

If you need to remove the components for the silent installation and have SmartSketch on the computer, remove SmartSketch and its associated components first. Continue by removing PD_Shell from the **PDS**

**remove product** utilities. This action prompts you to confirm deletio *n of*  the Intergraph SmartPlant Attribute Mapper. Select **Yes**, and confirm the deletion of all shared files.

This step does not delete Intergraph Smart P&ID Engineering Automation. To remove automation, go to **Add/Remove Programs**, select **Intergraph SPP&ID Automation** from the list, accept its deletion, and confirm deletion of all shared files. Then restart your computer.

Before re-installing any software in the client computer, delete the three folders specified above, and any files contained in them.

**Known Issues and Limitations**

The **Graphical P&ID Setup** command cannot convert and display a P&ID that has a space in the P&ID file path. Make sure the paths and filenames to the P&IDs have no spaces in them. You get the same result if you use a comma in the P&ID title.

When the P&ID plant hierarchy does not contain the **Unit** item, an error occurs when snapping to a piping segment or a component in the **PD_Design** environment.

You must define the **Option Code** property for a component in Smart P&ID Engineering if you are planning to use the **Name from P&ID** command for transferring any other component information. The implication is that your piping specifications must be created before drawing the P&IDs if you use this command for any data transfer.

You must dismiss the **Graphics Setup** menu after selecting the P&ID that you want to display.

Sometimes this form may be hidden, and you must dismiss it before you can transfer data from a pipeline.

Levels settings (that is, displays of drawing filters) are not saved for a Smart P&ID Engineering drawing. You must select the correct levels each time that you enter the drawing.

If you want to see the P&ID labels and line types correctly, you must map your P&ID fonts to proper MicroStation fonts in one of the .ini files. ISO Plus RDB fonts and borders.txt contain this information.

Also, the standard RDB Arial Narrow is mapped to a not-always-present MicroStation font and causes unreadable labels on the screen.

**Properties Glossary**

This glossary is intended to be a reference source for further information about the properties that belong to drawing objects. Item types and their properties are listed and related in this document.

If you encounter a property in the **Properties** window (or **Modify Item Type Properties** dialog in Data Dictionary Manager) that you want more information about, you can open the **Properties** node in the Table of Contents in this Properties Glossary. The properties are listed in alphabetical order.

Not every property that appears in the software is displayed directly in the **Properties** nodes of this glossary. For instance, Case properties (either **Control Case** or **Process Case**) apply to cases directly, which in turn are related to objects. For instance, if you are looking at an offline instrument, and you want to know more about the **Ctrl Case Min Voltage** property, this specific property does not appear in this glossary. However, you can look up the **Voltage Property** entry to obtain general information about voltage properties. The same principle applies for equipment items, for instance, whose properties include process cases. In order to determine if the property that you want to display information about is a case property, look in the categories in the **Properties** window. You must display a categorical view of the **Properties** window in order to see the categories, and you must display Case data, too. For more information about changing views of the **Properties** window in the Smart P&ID modeler, see Working with the Properties

Window in the *Smart P&ID Help*.

In Catalog Manager, all the case properties are automatically displayed. In Data Dictionary Manager, you have to select the **Complete list** option on the **Modify Item Type Properties** dialog in order to see all the Case properties.

The reason that this glossary does not list every property as it appears in the **Properties** window is that many of the properties there are actually “item attributions” and are properties that are constructed from the objects and properties in the database. Therefore, it does require extra work to discover their corresponding parts in this glossary.

The Data Model Excel spreadsheet is a two-dimensional representation of the application’s Data Model.

This spreadsheet lists item types, item properties, and data types, as well as all the constructed item attributions that apply to drawing objects. This list is alphabetical according to item type.

**Item Types**

This section describes the available drawing item types.

**AreaBreak**

The **AreaBreak** item type is a classification that identifies the model properties associated with a break shape on a drawing. Its purpose is to group objects graphically to create a select set of the contents. Labels and data can be established on an area break. There is no automatic update between the labels associated with the area break and the objects within the area break. No inconsistencies are generated at the area https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/e942bdfb-c154-4ac9-8687-2152270cce4f 508/573

break if the property values of the area break differ from those of the items inside. This item type is derived from the PlantItemGroup class.

**AreaBreakAttribute**

The **AreaBreakAttribute** item type is a classification of attributes associated to a shape by virtue of the labels associated with it. The area break attributes are dynamically created by placing labels on an area break.

**BoundedShape**

The **BoundedShape** item type is a classification that represents a shape enclosing a set of items. These items have equivalent property values associated with the break shape. This item type is derived from the **Representation** class. The **BoundedShape** representation is created when placing an AreaBreak or Revision Cloud annotation.

**BoundedShapeVertex**

The **BoundedShapeVertex** item type is a classification that represents a vertex defining the geometry of a bounded shape graphic. This item type is aggregated from the BoundedShape class. The software controls this item type. This is an internal item type; do not add values to it.

**Case**

A single instance of the **Case** Item Type aggregates one or more instances of the **CaseProcess** or **CaseControl** Item Types (which see) to form a set of case information. This set of case information may then be associated with any number of ModelItem instances to provide reference information for the indicated ModelItems.

**CaseControl**

The **CaseControl** Item Type is a classification that serves to store control related properties. This Item Type is aggregated from the Case class.

**CaseProcess**

original connector is deleted and replaced by two connectors, one on each side of the inline component. If the PipeRun or SignalRun is deleted from drawing into the Stockpile, then all Connector representations are deleted.

Each connector has two end points - End1 and End2. The “1” and “2” refer to the direction in which the connector was drawn. Each connector can be attached to a symbol on each of the two ends.

**ConnectorVertex**

The **ConnectorVertex** item type represents a point used to define the geometry of a connector.

**Drawing**

The **Drawing** item type graphically represents information related to the model design such as a process plant or a ship.

**DrawingProject**

Vent Silencer.

**Exchanger**

The **Exchanger** item type is a classification of equipment that permits heat transfer between two or more process streams. This item type is derived from the Equipment class. The item type in the system (Database Table) is Exchanger. The corresponding entry in the Equipment class is Heat Transfer Equipment.

**History**

The **History** item type is an item associated with a drawing or a model item that is used to record information about the creation or modification of the item. Example uses for the History record include that is used for detecting when a drawing is in a **Re-create** state, is displayed when doing a compare, and can be accessed for reporting and filtering.

History records are maintained on all ModelItems except for the following item types: PipingPoint

SignalPoint

PipeRun

SignalLine

History records are defined with a creation index = 3 and a modification index = 2.

3/13/25, 10:38 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

For all applicable ModelItems, the creation History record will be updated when the Commit method is used.

A modification History record is maintained for each Drawing. Changes made to items on the drawing made through automation using Commit will not change the Drawing’s modification History record, but will change the model item’s history record. This History record is closely related to the database’s recreate process. Even though this record can be accessed through automation, the Drawing modification History record should not be modified.

**HydraulicCircuit**

The **HydraulicCircuit** item type is a classification that provides a system for signals or physical quantities.

Its many-to-many relationship is with the Plant Item Group.

**Inconsistency**

The **Inconsistency** item type stores information about data inconsistencies that are generally between two adjacent objects. Inconsistencies in a drawing are shown by inconsistency indicators, blue exclamation mark symbols. The Rule Manager controls the behavior of inconsistencies.

**InlineComp**

The **InlineComp** item type is used to define information on items that are in a pipe run. All piping components are also inline components, but not all instruments are inline components. The display name is **Inline Component**. The inline component item type contains the relationship to the parent pipe run. When building a new symbol in Catalog Manager, the determination that the item is an inline component is controlled by the **IsInline** property.

**InstrFailMode**

The **InstrFailMode** item type is a classification used to describe the various failure modes associated with a given Instrument. This item type is aggregated by the Instrument class and navigation flows toward Instrument. The display name is **Instrument Failure Mode**.

**InstrFunction**

**Relationship**

The **Relationship** item type is a classification that represents the relationship between one or more model items.

**Representation**

The **Representation** item type is a classification that describes the symbology and graphical relationships of an item’s representation on the drawing. Every appearance of a Model item type on a drawing is recorded as the association of the ModelItem item type with a unique Representation item type. Any number of Representation item types may be associated with a ModelItem item type to indicate each depiction of the model item in a drawing. The Drawing data category holds all the classes strictly involved with the representation of items on a given drawing.

There are four types of representations:

LabelPersist

Symbol

Connector

BoundedShape

**Revision**

The **Revision** item type is related to the **Drawing** item type with a many-to-one relationship. The properties for this item type include major and minor revision number, revision date, and creation, checked, and approval information.

**RuleReference**

The **RuleReference** item type is a classification that represents a reference to a rule responsible for an inconsistency. Applicable rules are identified and saved as RuleReference Item Types in the database.

When a call is made to the RuleReference item type, it saves a flag that indicates whether it is responsible for the watched object or the logical parent of the watched object. If the flag is set, it must navigate from the watched object to the logical parent.

The RuleReference item type compares the indicated attribute values and updates the Inconsistency item type. For example, if the logical parent of the OPC item type does not exist, an inconsistency must be generated.

**SafetyClass**

The **SafetyClass** item type is a classification that groups items according to safety classifications. This item type is derived from the PlantItemGroup class.

**Status**

An instance of the **Status** item type may be associated with an instance of the **Drawing** or **ModelItem** item type to record any change in status (e.g. readiness or approval) of the related type. There should only be one instance of a given status type for an instance of a drawing or model item which differentiates this from History.

**Symbol**

The **Symbol** Item Type is a classification that represents a predefined graphical depiction. This Item Type is derived from the Representation class. A Symbol representation is created every time an item is placed on a drawing. Every PlantItem has an associated Symbol representation.

ModelItems, such as OPCs and ItemNotes also have symbol representations.

When a PipeRun or SignalRun is placed on a drawing, multiple representations are created.

Symbol representations can own the following RepresentationTypes: Gap, OPC, Symbol, and Branch.

Custom curved gap symbols are not supported.
