**Intergraph Smart® P&ID Insulation Specification Manager**

The complex process plants of today require the use of extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, to manufacture the products that you need.

To make the plants energy efficient and economical and to provide safety to workers, the use of insulation is required. Over the years, company standards have been developed that dictate the type and thickness of insulation based on temperature and other operating factors.

These standards make it feasible for the design software to select the proper insulation required and automatically enter it into the database.

This practice ensures proper design and speeds up the design process by freeing users from the laborious and error-prone task of entering property data.

Detailed insulation thickness calculations are necessary for each pipeline and piece of equipment in a plant. However, because insulation typically comes in a standard thickness, companies commonly generate tables of data that match the thickness required versus temperature and diameter. Different tables are generated for different conditions, for example, personnel protection or energy conservation. Intergraph Smart® P&ID Insulation Specification Manager provides users with a way to enter their table data such that it is electronically stored so that the software can access the data as required. In other words, the software does the table look-ups for you, so you do not spend valuable time looking through stacks of insulation tables.

**Navigating in Smart P&ID Insulation Specification Manager**

Smart P&ID Insulation Specification Manager displays a plant insulation specification file in a **Tree** view.

Folders organize specifications into insulation types: cork, glass wool, asbestos, and so forth. Within folders individual specifications are described. Open a folder by double-clicking it or by selecting the plus sign preceding the name. Review the properties of an individual specification by double-clicking it. The Insulation Specification Properties Dialog displays all the information about each specification.

The path to the active plant insulation specification file, which has the extension . *isl*, is defined in the reference data settings in Smart P&ID

Options Manager. In Smart P&ID Insulation Specification Manager, you can open a different database, create an entirely new plant specification file, or change the default path if you need to access a different plant file.

**Creating and Editing Insulation Specifications**

Every plant has different insulation needs, and Smart P&ID Insulation Specification Manager allows you to address those needs with customized insulation specifications. By creating and modifying specifications for the plant yourself, rather than using preset specifications, you ensure that the plant meets your criteria as closely as possible. This customization allows for safer, more energy- and time-efficient plant design.

By using the Add Specification Command in Smart P&ID Insulation Specification Manager, you can create custom specifications for a wide variety of uses from any standard insulating materials, with behaviors preset for use with both piping and equipment. Thickness options, layering, and exclusion filters let you create the necessary level of detail for your design. By setting up temperature and size ranges, you can create a specification that applies across a wide variety of piping systems and equipment. The temperature range refers to the operating range for the insulation specification only. It is not constrained to match any defined temperature for the item that you insulate in the design software.

By using the Properties Command, you can modify any preset insulation specification to suit your plant design needs.

**Create a New Insulation Specification**
