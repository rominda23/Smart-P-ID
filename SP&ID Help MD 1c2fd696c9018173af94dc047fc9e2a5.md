**Smart P&ID Program Group**

Smart P&ID provides multiple views of a central, unified data structure that represents the plant model. A view is a visual presentation of the data in the plant model and can be a schematic drawing or a table. The plant model is the computer representation of the conceptual design, including all plant components and their relationships. By manipulating model views, you can organize the information within the plant model to better understand and maintain the data.

Smart P&ID has several programs and utilities for running and managing your plant data.

**Smart P&ID** provides the design environment for

Smart P&ID drawings.

**Drawing Manager** allows you to create and delete

drawings, manage drawing versions, and print

multiple drawings.

**Insulation Specification Manager** allows you to

create and modify lookup tables for insulation

specifications and thicknesses.

**Options Manager** defines plant-wide graphic

standards for symbology, gapping, heat tracing, and

formats. Options Manager also defines paths to

Smart P&ID files and directories.

**Rule Manager** defines rules for placement and

property copying on placement.

**Navigating in the Software**

The drawing interface is divided into four distinct parts: the **Design** window, the **Catalog Explorer**, the **Engineering Data Editor**, and the **Properties** window. Each part provides specific features required to create drawings in the software.

**Design Window**

The **Design** window displays Drawing views and the **Engineering Data Editor**. Each of these views provide a way to enter information for the plant model into the database. The two views also provide different ways to view information in the database. In the Drawing view, you can see the traditional diagram of a plant containing equipment, instrumentation, and piping in a graphical representation. The **Engineering** **Data Editor** allows you to see the same information in a tabular format, and it can also display items in the plant and drawing stockpiles. See Working with the Design Window.

**Engineering Data Editor**

The **Engineering Data Editor** is a modification of the stockpile display. This view is exactly the same tabular view that displays in the **Design** window, with the same capabilities for modifying the display, editing

properties, and organizing data. See Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor.

**Catalog Explorer**

**Catalog Explorer** displays all available catalog items (symbols and assemblies) to use in drawings and plant models. Using **Catalog Explorer**, you can quickly navigate to the required catalog items, organize them as Favorites, add them to the Quick Catalog, or flag them for easy access. See Using Catalog

Explorer.

**Properties Window**

When you select an item in a plant model, you can enter, view and modify the properties associated with that item in the **Properties** window. The System Administrator defines customized properties and their defaults for each item in Data Dictionary Manager. See Working with the Properties Window.

**Working with the Design Window**

The **Design** view, or Modeler, consists of several parts and displays the model information for a design in a **Drawing** or **Engineering Data Editor** view. You can open as many windows as needed to support a design. Each window has its own independent set of properties defining view range, display properties, and so forth.

You can define one or more **Engineering Data Editors** for a drawing. The **Engineering Data Editor** displays drawing information in a table, much like a **Properties** pane. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, you can specify filters and layouts to define the table information and edit some item properties.

Using the commands on the **Window** menu, you can cascade or tile views to more easily navigate among them.

(1) **Title Bar**

Displays the site, plant, and drawing names.

(2) **Main Menu**

Displays the main menu commands such as **File**, **Edit**, **View**, **Tools**, **Integration**, **Reports**, **Window** and **Help**.

(3) **Command Toolbar**

Provides quick access to frequently used commands and features for creating and editing a PID drawing.

(4) **Catalog Explorer** **Pane**

Displays all available symbols and assemblies to use in drawings and plant models. See Using Catalog

Explorer.

(5) **Properties** **Pane**

A list of properties shown for a selected item or a select set of multiple items. You can attach the **Properties** pane to any edge of the main window.

(6) **Drawing** **View**

A graphical representation of the plant model. This view displays the common idea of a model: a diagram containing items such as equipment, piping, and instrumentation.

(7) **Engineering Data Editor**

A tabular view that presents the plant data in a tabular format. See Navigating in the Engineering Data

Editor.

Smart P&ID provides multiple views of a central, unified data structure that represents the plant model. A view is a visual presentation of the data that composes the plant model and can be a schematic drawing or a table. The plant model is the computer representation of the conceptual design in its entirety, including all plant components and their relationships. By manipulating model views, you can organize the information within the plant model to better understand and maintain the data.

The software continually updates the database as you edit a drawing; however, the software does not update the drawing file until you save the file (when you select **File** > **Save** or when you quit the program and save). Occasionally, the software can end in an abnormal way (for example, due to power outage). As a result, the database is updated with changes that you posted to the drawing, but the drawing file reflects the status when you last saved the drawing. When you re-open the drawing, the software recognizes that the drawing file is different from the database and displays a message: **One or more items** **in this drawing are inconsistent with the database**. Select **OK** to re-create the drawing from the database.

**Show Command**

Available on the **Drawing View** shortcut menu, the **Show** command allows you to choose to display drawing elements such as notes, labels and grids.

**Options Command (Tools Menu)**

Changes settings that control recently used files, screen appearance, placement information, export formats, and so forth. Opens the **Options** dialog.

**Options Dialog**

Sets options for the current drawing. For example, you can set the number of recently used files that appear on the **File** menu. Open this dialog by selecting **Tools** > **Options** on the main menu bar. The **Options** dialog has four tabs:

**General Tab (Options Dialog)**

**Colors Tab (Options Dialog)**

**Placement Tab**

**Files Tab**

**General Tab (Options Dialog)**

Sets options for updating links in the drawing and displaying the drawing, the status bar, and recently used files.

**Update links automatically at open**

Updates links automatically when a drawing is opened.

**Recently used files list**

Sets the number of entries for the recently used files list on the **File** menu.

**Display as printed**

Displays the drawing as it appears when you print it.

**Show status bar**

Displays the status bar at the bottom of the main window. When you point at the command button on the toolbar, the description appears in the status bar at the bottom of the window. Also, the status bar displays prompts that explain what to do at each step of the command, as well as messages about the operations the software is performing.

**Colors Tab (Options Dialog)**

Sets options for the background, highlight, selection, and handle colors in the drawing.

**Background**

Sets the default background color for all Drawing views in the active drawing.

**Highlight**

Sets the highlight color.

**Selected items**

Sets the color of selected items. The connect points in the drawing appear in this color, too.

**Handles**

Sets the color of handles when an item is selected.

**Use Defaults**

Sets all the colors listed above to the default display value.

To set the symbology (for example, the line weight and color) for item types throughout a plant structure, use Smart P&ID Options Manager.

**Placement Tab (Options Dialog)**

Sets the default construction status for the active drawing, and tolerances for locating items and moving around in the drawing.

**Default construction status**

Assigns the selected construction status to all placed items. This list contains the following options: **New**, **Existing**, and **Future**. The plant administrator sets the plant-wide default at setup, but this option allows you to change the default on a drawing-by-drawing basis. The construction status for an item appears in the **Properties** window when the item is selected. Also, the construction status can be set for individual drawing items by changing its value in the **Properties** window.

**Locate**

Specifies the range, called the locate zone, at which a candidate item is highlighted when another item approaches. A candidate item is any item in the drawing that meets the placement rules of the approaching item. For example, a pipe run can be a candidate item, and a valve can be an approaching item to that pipe run. The pipe is highlighted when the valve is within the locate tolerance. If you are not placing an item but only selecting drawing items, the locate tolerance defines how close the pointer must approach to select the item.

**Break-away**

Sets the number of pixels at which an item disconnects from its parent item. For example, to move a valve, you drag the valve. If you keep the pointer within the break-away tolerance from the line, the valve does not disconnect from the line.

**Place Partner OPC in Stockpile**

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Indicates that when a new off-page connector (OPC) is placed, the partner OPC is automatically stored in the Stockpile. If you clear this option, the **Set Stockpile Location of Partner OPC** dialog appears after you place a new OPC. Using this dialog, you can indicate the drawing in which the partner OPC is stored until you place it in that drawing.

For Smart P&ID Engineering, placement is not allowed. Therefore, the settings for the **Break-away** and** Place Partner OPC in Stockpile** options does not affect the software behavior.

**Set Stockpile Location of Partner OPC Dialog**

Opens after you place a connector on a drawing, unless you have selected the **Place Partner OPC in** **Stockpile** option on the **Placement** tab of the **Options** dialog. The **Set Stockpile Location of Partner** **OPC** dialog allows you to select the drawing stockpile and also the stockpile into which the partner of the new connector is placed.

**Plant Hierarchy**

Displays the hierarchical tree representation of the plant. When you select a node, the drawings associated with that node appear in the **Drawing list** area.

**Drawing list**

Displays all the drawings associated with the selected node on the **Plant Hierarchy** tree. Choose a stockpile from this view to associate the partner connector with.

**Files Tab (Options Dialog)**

Sets scaling options for inserting images or objects in the drawing and to specify the location for storing report templates.

**Scale reference files**

Sets a scale option for inserting an item when using the commands **Edit** > **Insert** > **Image** or **Edit** > **Insert**

> Object.
> 

**Coincident (1:1)**

The behavior for this setting depends on the item being inserted:

In the case of border (.igr) files, the graphics in the file is placed by default with full scale (1:1) coincident at the coordinates placed in the .igr file. The user can then select the graphics and manually move the graphics to a different location as desired. If the graphics in the .igr file is larger than the sheet size of the file being inserted into, the graphics will be resized to fit the sheet size.

In the case of image files (such as a bitmap), the file is displayed by default at full scale (1:1) coincident at the bottom left of the sheet it is inserted into. The user can then select a different location https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

to place the image as desired. If the graphics of the image file is larger than the sheet size of the file it is being inserted into, the image file will *not* be resized to fit the sheet size.

**Select Scale**

Sets the scale of inserted items to a standard ratio. The specified ratio defines the size of the inserted item in relation to its original size. For a 2:1 ratio, the inserted item is displayed at twice its original size.

The **Fit to Sheet** option in the** Select Scale** list determines a scale for the inserted item so that it fits the drawing sheet.

**Custom Scale**

Sets a custom scale for inserted items. For example, when you type 3 and 2 in each of the respective boxes, the scale of the inserted item is 3:2, or one-and-a-half times its original size.

**My Reports**

Specifies the folder where your user-defined or personal report templates are stored.

**Browse**

Opens the Browse Dialog, which allows you to select a local or network folder to store your user-defined report templates (**My Reports**).

**Browse Dialog**

Allows you to select a folder that contains your reports. Open this dialog by selecting **Tools** > **Options** > **Files Tab** > **Browse**.

**Navigating in the Engineering Data Editor**

The **Engineering Data Editor** (**EDE**) uses a grid or tabular format to display the query results for the database. The **Engineering Data Editor** is automatically displayed in the lower left of the main window, and you can also open the **Engineering Data Editor** in the **Design** window.

The standard **Engineering Data Editor** is displayed when you open a drawing and by default displays the data for items in the active drawing and Active Drawing Stockpile when you select an item type or a saved view. For convenient review and editing of plant data, you can open a standalone EDE which displays the data in all drawings in the plant and in the Stockpile. The standalone EDE is available when no drawing is open in Smart P&ID.

**The Engineering Data Editor Toolbar**

At the top of the **Engineering Data Editor** is the toolbar, which contains the following menu buttons: **Actions**

Includes commands that allow you to place multiple representations of an item, delete stockpile items or move items between stockpiles.

**Edit**

Includes commands that allow you to copy and paste data and to claim items or release claimed items.

**View**

Includes commands that allow you to edit, save, or delete **Engineering Data Editor** views, to filter or refresh the display, to generate reports, and to specify display settings for the views.

Select the down-arrow next to the menu button to expose the available commands.

The list on the toolbar contains filters that query the database and display the corresponding items in the **Engineering Data Editor**. If you want to list all items, select **Plant Item** from the list.

You can also filter the display by using the buttons that correspond to different stockpiles and drawings (by default, initially only the **Active Drawing** and **Active Drawing Stockpile** buttons are selected): **Active Drawing**

Displays properties of the items that belong to the drawing you are currently viewing. This includes properties of implied items, which do not appear on the drawing sheet. This option is disabled in a standalone EDE.

**Active Drawing Stockpile**

Displays items existing in the data model that have not been placed in the graphic drawing. All items in the Active Drawing Stockpile, other than plant item groups, can be placed in the active drawing only. This option https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

is disabled in a standalone EDE.

**Stockpile**

Displays items for the plant existing in the data model that have not been placed in the graphic drawing. All items in the Stockpile, other than plant item groups, can be placed in *any* drawing.

**Other Drawings**

Displays properties of the items that appear in all drawings in the plant other than the active drawing, including items in the stockpiles of other drawings.

The list box displays available item types for selection as well as any saved views.

**Asking Filter**

Displays the **Filter** tab of the **Asking Filter** dialog, from which you can quickly filter the **Engineering Data** **Editor** display by selecting a base filter and properties appropriate for the selected item type. You can re-query and thereby refresh the **Engineering Data Editor** display by selecting the **Refresh** button . Finally, a summary box displays a comparison between the number of items in the view and the total number of items, of the type chosen in the list, that exist in the database.

When pagination is invoked, filter applies to the entire data set.

**Refresh**

Refreshes the **Engineering Data Editor**.

**Save to Excel**

Saves the current EDE view to an Excel sheet.

**Cancel Grouping** /** Enable Grouping**

Toggles the display of the Grouping area above the EDE. Selecting **Cancel Grouping** hides the Grouping area and cancels any current grouping of the data. After canceling, the Grouping area remains hidden even if you select a different item type to display in the EDE.

**Standalone EDE Command (File > Open Menu)**

This command is only available when Smart P&ID is opened without selecting any drawing. It opens a standalone version of the **Engineering Data Editor** and on selecting an item type, all items of that type in the plant and in the plant stockpile are displayed in the EDE grid. In a standalone EDE, you can run all the commands for querying and editing the data as you can in a standard EDE.

**Open a standalone EDE**

1. Open Smart P&ID.

1. Go to **File** > **Open** > **Standalone EDE**.
2. Select the item type whose data you want to display.

In the standalone EDE, the **Stockpile** and **Other Drawings** buttons are enabled, while the **Active Drawing** and **Active Drawing Stockpile** buttons are disabled.

If you select a row in the EDE and run the **Highlight in Drawing** command, the drawing containing the item opens and the standalone EDE becomes a standard EDE with the **Active Drawing** and **Active Drawing Stockpile** buttons enabled.

If you subsequently open a drawing from the **Open** > **Smart P&ID Drawing** command or from Drawing Manager, the standalone EDE with any displayed data closes and an instance of the standard EDE is displayed.

**Customizing the Engineering Data Editor**

You can change the content and layout of the **Engineering Data Editor** rather extensively.

By specifying the display settings, you can define the font that Stockpile items appear in, for instance. You can also use display settings to clarify the cells that are read-only and the cells that allow you to enter new property information or modify existing information. You can filter one or more columns and limit the number of items displayed. Create your own filters to narrowly define the contents of the view and create unique layouts with specific properties in the order you want.

After you have defined and edited a view, you can save it and also delete it later, if necessary.

**Customize the Data in the Current Engineering Data Editor View**

The software allows you to perform various actions in an open view. You can customize the grid view in the following ways:

**Search the Grid**

In the **Search** field, as you type, items that match the search criteria are highlighted in yellow in the grid. To clear your search, click the X on the right.

If none of the cells in a row contain the search string, that row is hidden from the view.

If none of the cells in the entire grid contain the search string, all the data rows are hidden and the **Search** field is displayed with a red border.

When pagination is invoked, you can apply the search to all pages or to the current page only. The search options work as follows with pagination:

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

**Current Page** — Displays only the rows from the current page that have matching strings. If there are no matching strings on a particular page, all the rows on that page are displayed.

**All Pages** — Displays the rows from all the pages that have matching strings. The rows are displayed in one or more pages corresponding to the total number of rows with matching strings and the number of rows per page that was set.

**Group Columns in the Grid**

To group your data by a specific attribute, drag the column header to the **Grouping** area where the following text appears: “Drag a column header and drop it here to group by that column.” You can group more than one attribute, by dragging another column header to this **Grouping** area. The order in which you apply the grouping changes the order of the displayed results.

When pagination is invoked, grouping is applied to the current page only.

In the **Engineering Data Editor**, if the Grouping area is not visible, select the **Enable Grouping** button on the EDE toolbar.

**Freeze Columns**

To freeze columns, hold the cursor between the leftmost column and the adjacent column until it changes to a double-headed arrow, and then drag the vertical bar to the end of the last column you want to freeze. To unfreeze columns, position the cursor on the bar and when it changes to a double-headed arrow, drag the bar back to the extreme left.

**Apply text wrapping to a column**

Text wrapping is not applied to the column data, by default. It is applied to individual columns using a shortcut menu. To apply text wrapping to a column, right-click the column header and select **Wrap Text**.

**Sort Items in the Grid**

The first time you open a view, the results are displayed in an ascending order based on the **Item Tag** column. Select a column header to sort by the values in that header in ascending order. To change the https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

sorting order to descending, select the column header again. A small arrow in the column header displays the sort order. Selecting the column header a third time removes the sorting (rows are sorted in ascending order by the **Item Tag** column values). Press and hold the SHIFT key and select columns to sort by more than one column. When sorting by multiple columns, the column headers display a small number beside the arrow to indicate the column sequence for sorting:

When sorting column values in ascending order, the sorting behavior depends on the type of data as follows:

For columns with units of measure, the values are sorted in order of SI value regardless of the units, for example: 3.5 mm, 3.0 cm, 2.000 in, 4.0 in. Where several identical SI values exist, sorting is as follows:

Identical values with the same units of measure, but with a different number of decimal places are sorted in ascending order according to the number of decimal places, for example: 2.0 in, 2.000 in.

Identical values with different formats based on the same type of units of measure are sorted in ascending alphabetical order of the units (with symbols preceding letters of the alphabet), for example: 3.0”, 3.0 in or 5.0 mil, 5.0 mm.

Values for all other data types are sorted alphabetically.

Cells with NULL values are not sorted and always appear at the top of the grid.

Empty cells are sorted and appear at the top when sorting in ascending order and at the bottom when sorting in descending order.

When pagination is invoked, sorting applies to the entire data set.

**Filter Items in the Grid**

1. To filter your data, select **Filter**  in the column header.
2. Set the filter parameters in the **Filter by Column Data** dialog: Use **Search** to find specific strings.

Select the required strings from the distinct strings list. Or, you can select all the distinct strings in the list using the **Select All** checkbox. See **Select All** in the** **Filter by Column Data Dialog.

In the **Show rows with value that** section, select the required operator from the list, then type a value in the blank field, and if required, select **And/Or.**

1. Select **Filter**.

To remove the filter criteria for a column:

1. Select **Filter**  in the column header.
2. In the Filter by Column Data Dialog, select **Clear Filter.**

If an identical string appears in more than one row in the grid, that string is shown only once in the list.

If a column includes empty values, a checkbox with the value **[empty]** appears in the list.

When filtering numerical data with units of measure, the filtered results are sorted in order of SI value regardless of the units.

A filtered column is indicated by a solid **Filter** icon .

If the filter is already applied and a filtered value is changed to a new value outside the range defined by the filter, the row with the new value is immediately excluded from the grid display.

When pagination is invoked, filter applies to the entire data set.

You can filter the items displayed in the **Engineering Data Editor** by using the column filter. For example, if the **Engineering Data Editor** displays **Equipment: Vessels** but you want to see only towers, select the Filter icon at the top of the **Eq Subclass** column and choose **Towers**.

To create more elaborate filters and displays, use the **Edit View** command and enter options in the **Edit** **View** and **Advanced View Properties** dialogs. See Define a Filter for an Engineering Data Editor View.

**Apply Filters in the Engineering Data Editor**

1. Select **Filter** from the column header for the column you want to filter.
2. Set the filter parameters in the **Filter by Column Data** dialog: Use **Search** to find specific strings.

Select the required strings from the distinct strings list. Or, you can select all the distinct strings in the list using the **Select All** checkbox. See **Select All** in the** **Filter by Column Data Dialog.

In the **Show rows with value that** section, select the required operator from the list, then type a value in the blank field, and if required, select **And/Or.**

1. Select **Filter**.

To remove the filter criteria for a column:

1. Select **Filter**  in the column header.
2. In the Filter by Column Data Dialog, select **Clear Filter.**

If an identical string appears in more than one row in the grid, that string is shown only once in the list.

If a column includes empty values, a checkbox with the value **[empty]** appears in the list.

When filtering numerical data with units of measure, the filtered results are sorted in order of SI value regardless of the units.

A filtered column is indicated by a solid **Filter** icon .

If the filter is already applied and a filtered value is changed to a new value outside the range defined by the filter, the row with the new value is immediately excluded from the grid display.

When pagination is invoked, filter applies to the entire data set.

**Filter by Column Data Dialog**

Opens when you select the Filter icon at the top of a column in the **Engineering Data Editor**. Allows you to specify filter criteria for the selected column to determine the display of items in the **EDE**.

When specifying three or more criteria, it is recommended that you avoid using complex combinations of **And** or **Or** operators to prevent unwanted results of the filtering.

**Clear Filter**

Clears all previously-defined filter settings and closes the dialog.

**Search**

Performs a search-as-you-type filter on column values for which any part of the column value matches the search string.

**Select All**

Use to select all the distinct strings displayed in the list. The filter can be applied on a maximum of 5000

distinct strings. If the strings you selected exceed 5000, the software displays a message stating that you have exceeded the selection limit, and the **Filter** button is unavailable.

**(Unique value check boxes)**

Displays the distinct strings for all the values that appear in the column. If the column contains blank cells, these are indicated by the value **[empty]**. Select checkboxes beside the values to be included; clear the checkboxes beside the values to be excluded.

**Show rows with value that**

Allows you to specify additional filter criteria based on strings that comprise all or part of the data values.

The criteria specified under **Show rows with value that** are *additive* with respect to the filtered values specified by the check boxes, that is, when both sections are used to define a filter, they make the filter more restrictive. These criteria might not work as expected for certain values of the Nominal Diameter property.

The available comparison operator options for columns whose data type is *string* or *select list* are as follows:

**Is Equal To**

**Is Not Equal To**

**Is Less Than**

**Is Less Than Or Equal to**

**Is Greater Than**

**Is Greater Than Or Equal to**

For data of *string* type only, the following additional comparison operator options are available: **Starts With**

**Ends With**

**Contains**

**Does Not Contain**

When specifying several criteria, you can choose **And** or **Or** to specify the relationship between the criteria as follows:

**And -** Means that both the current and succeeding criteria must be met.

**Or -** Means that either the current or succeeding criteria must be met.

**Add**

Adds a row for a new criterion below the current criterion (not available for the first criterion row).

Delete

Deletes the entire row containing the criterion (not available for the first two criteria rows). Select the ‘x’

beside the string used to specify the value of the criterion to clear that value.

**Filter**

Displays the filtered results in the EDE.

**Pagination**

When displaying data rows in the **Engineering Data Editor**, there is a setting that limits the number of data rows that can be displayed in the EDE view. If the number of rows exceeds this number, the software creates additional pages for the display of the data rows. By default, the number of rows per page is set to 500; however, you can change this number to any value between 5 and 3000.

Below the EDE grid, **Displaying Rows** shows:

The total number of rows available in the database for an EDE query.

The number of rows matching the column filter or the search criteria.

When you apply a column filter or a search, the number of rows matching the filter or search criteria and the total number of rows in the database for the selected item type are displayed.

When you apply pagination in the EDE view, the number of rows displayed on the current page and the total number of rows in the database are displayed.

In the above example:

1 to 5 is the range of rows displayed in the current page.

20 is the resultant rows for the search or column filter criteria.

50 is the total number of rows in the database for the EDE query.

Reducing the number of rows displayed per page improves performance when displaying, filtering, sorting, or searching data rows.

**Set the number of rows to display per page**

Below the EDE grid, in the **Rows per page** box, type a number between 5 and 3000 and press **Enter** or **Tab** to set the value.

When you open a session of the Smart P&ID Modeler, the number of rows per page is set to 500 by default.

When you change the value in the **Rows per page** box and make other changes in the EDE, selecting the **Refresh** button also sets the new value.

**Search for data on multiple pages**

When pagination is applied to the EDE, you can apply the search to all pages or to the current page only.

The search options work as follows with pagination:

**Current Page**

Displays only the rows from the current page that have matching strings. If there are no matching strings on a particular page, all the rows on that page are displayed.

**All Pages**

Displays the rows from all the pages that have matching strings. The rows are displayed in one or more pages corresponding to the total number of rows with matching strings and the number of rows per page that was set.

**Navigate between pages**

Use the navigation controls to move back and forth between pages or to go to the first or last page. To go to a particular page, type the number of that page in the box and press the **Tab** key.

**Editing Item Properties in the Engineering Data Editor**

Item properties in the **Engineering Data Editor** can be edited much the same way as they are in the **Properties** window; however, there are some differences:

The software displays a different background color for read-only and read/write properties in the **Engineering Data Editor**. These display options are configured on the **Display Settings** dialog. See

Customize the Display of the Engineering Data Editor.

The **Engineering Data Editor** can be configured to display properties that are not shown in the **Properties** window. See Define a Layout for an Engineering Data Editor View.

Properties of items in non-active drawings and non-active drawing stockpiles can be edited in the **Engineering Data Editor**. See Perform Plant Editing.

When editing a select list property in the **Properties** window, it is possible to select the property from the list or to type part or all of the value directly in the field. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, it is also possible to select the property from the list; when selecting a value by typing, it is possible to type the first letter of the property value or to type letters in succession quickly to choose a particular value. If several property values start with a particular letter, repeatedly typing that letter in an **Engineering** **Data Editor** cell allows you to move through those values.

Using the CTRL or SHIFT key in the **Engineering Data Editor**, it is possible to select multiple properties (cells) for an item (row), copy those properties, and paste them to other items.

A list arrow (select list) and an ellipsis (calculation button) are displayed for a property in the **Engineering Data Editor** much the same as in the **Properties** window except for the case when both exist for the property. When both the list arrow and the ellipsis exist for a property (for example, the **Loop Tag** property of a pipe run) they are both displayed in the **Properties** window but only the list arrow is displayed in the **Engineering Data Editor**.

In the **Properties** window, you can highlight a value that belongs to a select list and simply clear its contents by pressing the **Delete** key. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, you must first highlight the value inside the list before being able to delete it.

All Plant Item Group associations are editable in both the **Properties** window and in the **Engineering** **Data Editor**. One exception is the **Hydraulic Circuit Item Tag** property, which is editable in the **Properties** window but is read-only in the **Engineering Data Editor**.

If the selected item (row) in the **Engineering Data Editor** is in the active drawing, that item is highlighted in the drawing and its properties are displayed in the **Properties** window as if it had been selected in the drawing. If the selected item is in a non-active drawing, its properties are *not* displayed in the **Properties** window; however, on the shortcut menu, the **Highlight in Drawing** command can be used to open the drawing in which the item appears. Selecting this command zooms in on the item in the drawing that opens, highlights it, and displays its properties in the **Properties** window.

The **Plant Group Name** property is dependent on the **Plant Group Type** property and hence the **Plant Group Name** property cannot be assigned until the **Plant Group Type** property is assigned. If you remove the **Plant Group Type** property, then **Plant Group Name** property is also removed. Both the **Plant Group Type** and **Plant Group Name** properties have to be assigned for an item, therefore if the **Plant Group Type** property is assigned and the **Plant Group Name** property is not available or removed for an item, the software removes the **Plant Group Type** value as follows: **Active drawing and stockpile view**: Whether the change is made in the **Properties** window or in the **Engineering Data Editor**, the **Plant Group Type** value is not removed while in the same drawing session. Refreshing the **Engineering Data Editor** does not remove the **Plant Group** **Type** value. Only closing the drawing removes the **Plant Group Type** value.

**Other drawing**: If **Pagination** is enabled in **Engineering Data Editor**, then toggling the **Other** **Drawing** view removes the **Plant Group Type** value. If **Pagination** is not enabled, then refreshing the **Engineering Data Editor** removes the **Plant Group Type** value.

When copying and pasting data between cells in the **Engineering Data Editor** where one property is dependent upon another, the higher dependent (parent) property must be in a column to the left of the dependency (child) property in the layout. For example, if copying both **Fluid System** and **Fluid Code** property values from one row to one or more other rows in the **Engineering Data Editor**, **Fluid System** must be located to the left of **Fluid Code** in the layout. Likewise, if copying **Plant Group Type** and **Plant** **Group Name** properties, **Plant Group Type** must be located to the left of **Plant Group Name** in the layout.

**Edit the Engineering Data Editor View**

1. On the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar, select the arrow beside the **View** menu icon and from the menu list, select **Edit View**.
2. On the **Edit View** dialog, define the items that you want to see in the **Engineering Data Editor**. You can customize a filter and layout for the display on the **Advanced View Properties** dialog . See

Modify the Properties of an Existing Engineering Data Editor View.

The software identifies read-only properties in the **Engineering Data Editor** visually by using the display options that you set using the **Display Settings** command. See Customize the Display of the

Engineering Data Editor.

**Edit Active Drawing Item Properties in the Engineering Data Editor** Two possibilities are available for updating drawing item properties in the **Engineering Data Editor**: Direct editing of properties

Copying and pasting property values

To display the data for editing, choose an item type from the **Engineering Data Editor** select list or ensure that **Active Drawing** is selected to display properties of the items that appear in the drawing you are currently viewing.

You can also display or hide stockpile items by toggling the **Active Drawing Stockpile** and **Stockpile** commands.

If a cell is populated by a read-only property or a property that is only automatically generated by validation, you cannot edit or paste data into that cell.

**Edit the data in the grid**

1. Select any cell in the grid and enter your new content or change existing content as follows: For text, select the cell and just type the required value.

For a list of values (or equivalent quantitative values with different units of measure), double-click the cell and select the required value from the drop-down list that becomes available.

For a field with a calculation command (ellipsis), double-click the cell and then select the ellipsis to open a dialog.

1. When done, select outside the cell to exit Edit mode and save the contents.

When populating cells with numeric values, enter a number within the minimum and maximum values that an integer data type can handle; that is, between 0 and 2147483647.

If you change a property value of an active drawing item in the **Engineering Data Editor** and this causes other properties in the active drawing to be updated because System Editing or validation is activated, the software automatically updates the **Engineering Data Editor** display.

If a property value in the **Engineering Data Editor** is changed by the user or as a result of an automatic update and this property is used for sorting, the software does not update the sort order of the data automatically if the values are no longer in the correct order.

When editing the **Plant Group Name** property in the **Engineering Data Editor** or the **Properties** window, if identical plant group names exist, holding the mouse pointer over a selected value from the list displays a tool tip showing the plant group hierarchy path for that value. Therefore, if two units named U1 are available in the list, displaying the tool tip will show the different paths for the names; for example **\A1\U1** and **\A2\U1**.

When editing a date field, selecting in the field activates the date picker window. It is not possible to type values in a date field. To clear a value from a date field, select in the field and press the space, **Backspace**, or **Delete** key. The same behavior applies for the **Properties** window.

**Copy and paste data**

You must exit Edit mode to be able to copy and paste data.

1. Select the cell with the data you want to copy, right-click and select **Copy** on the shortcut menu.
2. Select a target cell (single-click) or multiple cells (using the CTRL or SHIFT key) where you want to paste the data, right-click and on the shortcut menu, select **Paste**.

If you selected a single row as the source, you can paste the content of that row into multiple target rows (excluding the cells related to the item tag).

A red border appears around a cell if the copied contents cannot be pasted into that cell because, for example, the cell is read-only or the data type of the target cell is incompatible with the data type of the copied contents.

The copied information will be cleared (and so will the copy – dash indication) from the clipboard and not pasted in the following cases:

When the selected cell is in Edit mode (activated by double-clicking the cell).

When one or more of the changes are made to the EDE layout, such as editing the EDE definition, column addition, column re-ordering, splitting the screen, applying a filter, or sorting.

See Copy and Paste EDE Data - Troubleshooting.

**Copy and Paste EDE Data - Troubleshooting**

If the copy/paste is not successful, one of the following messages is displayed in the ribbon bar: **Cannot paste the selected cells:**

Check you have selected destination cells.

Check that the selected cells are not in Edit mode.

Make sure that the selected destination layout matches the copied cells layout. The destination area needs to contain the same layout of rows and columns as the source.

**Cannot set lookup value from different source:**

You are trying to paste a value from a cell where the values are from a select list to a cell that cannot contain select list values. For example, a value copied from a select list of instrument manufacturers cannot be pasted to a cell with a select list of model numbers. You can only copy select list value to a cell with the same select list type or to a blank cell.

**Cannot set value to read-only cell:**

You are trying to paste a value into a cell whose properties have been set to read-only.

**Item cannot be pasted into list:**

You are trying to paste a value from a cell whose properties have a dependency on another property. For example, if a panel model in a particular cell is related to manufacturer Honeywell, it can only be pasted into another panel model cell for which the related manufacturer is also Honeywell.

**Plant Editing**

Plant Editing is the ability to use the **Engineering Data Editor** to manage data for all objects in the plant. If System Editing is enabled, data that is edited will propagate according to the System Editing rules defined for the plant.

**Plant Editing of Objects in Non-Active Drawings**

If a user edits an object in a non-active drawing, propagation of data takes place across Off-Page Connectors (OPCs) to other non-active drawings when all the drawings involved are not opened by a user.

**Plant Editing of Objects in an Active Drawing**

If a user edits an object in the active drawing, data will not propagate across OPCs beyond the active drawing boundary. Because the active drawing opened by the user is in a locked state, any data changes made in a non-active drawing will not propagate back across OPCs to the active drawing.

**Perform Plant Editing**

1. In Options Manager, select **Settings** and set the value for the **Enable Plant Editing** setting to **Yes**.
2. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, choose an item type from the **Engineering Data Editor** select list, for example, **Pipe Run**.
3. Ensure that **Active Drawing** is selected to display properties of the items that appear in the drawing you are currently viewing.
4. Select **Other Drawings** to display properties of the items that appear in all the non-active drawings in the plant. Selecting this option also displays items in the drawing stockpiles of the other drawings.
5. Edit the data in the cell (field) in accordance with the data type: For text, select the cell and just type the required value.

For a list of values (or equivalent quantitative values with different units of measure), double-click the cell and select the required value from the drop-down list that becomes available.

For a field with a calculation command (ellipsis), double-click the cell and then select the ellipsis to open a dialog.

The ability to perform Plant Editing for non-active drawings only applies to the default **Engineering** **Data Editor** window. Editing item properties of non-active drawings is not supported in a new **Engineering Data Editor** window that is opened using the **Window** > **New** > **Engineering Data** **Editor** command.

While you are editing an item that belongs to another drawing, other users will only be able to open that drawing in read-only mode. In this case, the other user will receive a message that the drawing is open; (in Drawing Manager, the **Accessed By** field for that drawing shows the person who has the drawing open). To make the other drawing editable for other users, you must move the cursor out of any **Engineering Data Editor** row representing an item in the drawing. If the drawing is open as read-only, it will have to be re-opened in order to be editable.

When editing the **Plant Group Name** property in the **Engineering Data Editor** or the **Properties** window, if identical plant group names exist, holding the mouse pointer over a selected value from the list displays a tool tip showing the plant group hierarchy path for that value. Therefore, if two units named U1 are available in the list, displaying the tool tip will show the different paths for the names; for example **\A1\U1** and **\A2\U1**.

In a project, you cannot perform Claim / Release Claim operations in the **Engineering Data Editor** for items that belong to other drawings.

Editing items from other drawings clears the Undo buffer for the active drawing.

Editing items from other drawings creates out-of-date model items, which can be updated using the **Out-of-Date Drawings** > **Update** command. See Update Command (File > Out-of-Date Drawings Menu) in Drawing Manager Help.

If you use Plant Editing to change a property value in a non-active drawing, propagation occurs according to the System Editing rules defined for the plant and the **Engineering Data Editor** display is automatically updated. This includes propagation of data between non-active drawings across Off-Page Connectors (OPCs) when both drawings involved are not opened by a user. Propagation does *not* occur across OPCs between the active drawing and a non-active drawing.

In the **OPC** view in the **Engineering Data Editor**, it is not possible to edit OPC properties in non-active drawings; however, OPC properties in the active drawing or in the plant or active drawing stockpiles can be edited.

If a property value in the **Engineering Data Editor** is changed by the user or as a result of an automatic update and this property is used for sorting, the software does not update the sort order of the data automatically if the values are no longer in the correct order.

Certain restrictions exist for editing items in the **Engineering Data Editor** where those items belong to other drawings. These restrictions are summarized in the following table.

**Batch Copy Item Properties Using Plant Editing**

This option applies where the cell contents are compatible.

1. On the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar, choose an item type from the select list, for example, **Pipe** **Run**.
2. Select the scope for the display of the data (**Active Drawing**, **Other Drawings**, stockpiles).
3. If needed, apply a filter to display only the data rows where you want to copy data.
4. Right-click in the field from which you want to copy data and select **Copy** on the shortcut menu.
5. Select the field to which you want to copy data, or hold down SHIFT while selecting several consecutive fields in a column.
6. Right-click, and select **Paste** on the shortcut menu.

If you use Plant Editing to change a property value in a non-active drawing, propagation occurs according to the System Editing rules defined for the plant and the **Engineering Data Editor** display is automatically updated. This includes propagation of data between non-active drawings across Off-Page Connectors (OPCs) when both drawings involved are not opened by a user. Propagation does *not* occur across OPCs between the active drawing and a non-active drawing.

If a property value in the **Engineering Data Editor** is changed by the user or as a result of an automatic update and this property is used for sorting, the software does not update the sort order of the data automatically if the values are no longer in the correct order.

**Batch Replace Properties that Include Units of Measure Using Plant Editing** This option applies where the cell contents have identical values and units of measure.

1. On the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar, choose an item type from the select list, for example, **Pipe** **Run**.
2. Select the scope for the display of the data (**Active Drawing**, **Other Drawings**, stockpiles).
3. If needed, apply a filter to display only the data rows with identical values and units of measure.
4. Select a field with the preferred value, and select an alternative format from the list. This changes to the equivalent value in the new units of measure. For example, 50 psi becomes 2.4 bar g. You can also change to a different format for the *same*  units of measure; for example, where 50 psi becomes 50.254 psi.
5. Right-click in the field from which you want to copy data and select **Copy** on the shortcut menu.

In case of a connector, this command is not available unless the partner connector is in one of the stockpiles.

For equipment components, the **Engineering Data Editor** view does not include a filter for Item Status = ‘Active’ (unlike other item types). Therefore the row corresponding to the item that was deleted from the stockpile is still shown in the view but becomes read-only after refreshing the **Engineering Data Editor** display; the item is removed from the display only when you close and reopen the drawing.

After deleting a stockpile item from the model, you can restore it to the stockpile (and then to the drawing) using the **Edit** > **Undo** command on the main menu, unless you have performed one of the actions that clears the Undo buffer. See Undo Command (Edit Menu).

**Move to Different Stockpile Command**

Allows you to move a stockpile item from one stockpile to another. For instance, you can move an item from the Stockpile into the stockpile for your active drawing if you know the item belongs in that drawing but are not yet ready to place the item. Similarly you can move an item in the Drawing Stockpile to the Stockpile so that it can be used in other drawings. You can even move items from one drawing stockpile to another. The **Move to Different Stockpile** dialog opens.

**Edit Menu (Engineering Data Editor)**

Allows you to copy and paste values from one cell to another cell in the **Engineering Data Editor** and to select all the items in the view in order to create a select set. You can also invoke a claim at any time to expand the scope of your project, and any new item created in a project is automatically claimed by that project. You can also release a claim at any time and you can determine the validity of a claim.

Select the down-arrow next to the **Edit** menu button to display the available commands.

**Copy Command**

Places the value in the currently selected cell onto the Clipboard so that you can paste it somewhere else.

This command does not remove the value from the selected table cell. Values placed on the Clipboard remain there until newer values are copied over them.

**Paste Command**

Places the value from the Clipboard into the selected cell. If the cell is read-only, then the **Paste** command is not available. You must have previously placed a value on the Clipboard to paste it.

**Select All Command**

Chooses all the items in the active **Engineering Data Editor**. You can create a select set using this command.

**Using Catalog Explorer**

**Catalog Explorer** is an interface used to view and manipulate an electronic catalog containing catalog items and their associated properties. Catalog items may be drawing symbols or labels. Conceptually, **Catalog Explorer** resembles a manufacturer’s catalog with pictures of parts to build a plant. The catalog contains items organized by categories represented by the folder structure under the **Symbols** folder in the reference data and also items designated by users as Favorites. **Catalog Explorer** includes the following features for easy navigation:

Favorites section

Quick Catalog

Flags used to mark catalog items for searching

The following issues can occur when opening a drawing in Smart P&ID: The first time **Catalog Explorer** is opened for a new plant, it displays in a disabled state.

If a symbol is added or updated in **Catalog Manager**, the symbol appears as disabled in **Catalog** **Explorer**.

These display problems usually occur because the user has read-only access rights to the Smart P&ID

reference data folder. To fix them, an administrator with ‘Full Control’ permissions in Options Manager must run the **Generate Symbol Images** command in Options Manager in order to update the symbol images and the CatalogExplorerSettings.bin file in the reference data folder.

**Working with the Properties Window**

The **Properties** window display is a two-column table that provides the common properties of the current selection in the active **Design** window. The active items always determine the content of the **Properties** window. You can only have one **Properties** window open. If only one component is selected, or all components are of the same type, all the properties of that type of component appear. If your select set contains components of different types, then only the common properties appear. If the selected items have different values for their common properties, the value box is blank.

You can modify the values for properties in the **Properties** window. You can display and edit relationships that involve components, component types, or assemblies.

At the top of the **Properties** window is the **Selected Items** list, which itemizes all of the selected objects individually and as a select set. You can display item properties by locating the appropriate item in the **Selected Items** list, as well as by selecting an item in the **Design** window. An item and the properties that belong to it are associated when the item is created in Catalog Manager. If more than one item is selected https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

in the **Design** window, then the **Selected Items** list contains the choice **Select Set** as well as individual items in the set.

You can use the **Copy Bulk Properties** and **Paste Bulk Properties** buttons to copy properties from one item to another. This action can be particularly useful when correcting inconsistencies, for instance, or when you must apply changes to more than one item. The software includes a default set of bulk properties, but you can change those properties specified as bulk in the **Usage** box on the **Layout** tab of the **Advanced** **View Properties** dialog.

If you copy or paste values in the grid area, use CTRL + C and CRTL + V. Do not use the **Edit** > **Copy**, **Edit** > **Paste**, or **Edit** > **Cut** menu commands to modify property values in this grid.

**Display > Properties Window Command**

See Copy Bulk Properties.

**Paste Bulk Properties**

Pastes copied bulk properties onto the newly selected item or items. You must have previously selected an item or items and copied bulk properties. See Paste Bulk Properties.

**Display Null**

Displays a null value in blank properties that currently contain no value.This option helps avoid confusion between empty cells and cells containing a zero. See Display Null Values in the Properties Window.

**Show Case Data**

Displays a list of case conditions, for example, temperatures, pressures, and so forth. Case data includes control cases, which are displayed for equipment, pipe runs, or instruments, according to relevance. To see the case data that appears for corresponding items, look in Data Dictionary Manager.

Are toggle icons that control how the properties of a select set are displayed when you do any of the following:

Fence select multiple items

Use the **Select All** command

Select multiple items in the EDE

Use the **Select Connected Items** command

A change to this option does *not* affect the display of properties for an *existing* select set but rather which properties will be displayed when a new select set is created by any of the above actions. If you select multiple items by using the CTRL key, the software displays the select set properties regardless of the option chosen.

**Show Select Set**

Indicates that the **Single Item** view is active. Before creating the select set, select the icon to display the common properties of the selected items.

**Show Single Item**

Indicates that the **Select Set** view is active. Before creating the select set, select the icon to display the properties of one item only.

2. If more than one item is selected in the Drawing view or in the **Engineering Data Editor**, use the **Selected Items** list at the top of the **Properties** window to choose a single item or the select set of all listed items.
3. Specify how properties are displayed in the **Properties** window toolbar. Select **Alphabetic**  to display properties alphabetically or select **Categorized**  to display properties by categories.
4. Display only brief properties by selecting **Show Brief Properties** .
5. Display case data by selecting **Show Case Data** .
6. Display a null character in empty property cells by selecting **Display Null** .
7. Specify how the properties of a select set are displayed:

Select **Show Select Set** to display the common properties of a set of items subsequently selected.

Select **Show Single Item** to display the properties of a single item among a set of items subsequently selected. Note that if you select multiple items by holding down the CTRL key, the software displays the select set properties even if this option is selected.

The properties that are subsequently displayed in the window belong to the chosen item or the select set. For the select set, only properties that all items have in common appear, and only common values are displayed for those properties. Consequently, empty property values for a select set do not necessarily mean that no value has been assigned for any of the items in the set, only that either no value has been assigned or that the different items have different values for the property.

Whenever you have constructed a select set, you can choose single items from that set by using the **Selected Items** list at the top of the **Properties** window. A single item chosen in a select set this way is highlighted in a different color in the Drawing view.

**Review and Edit Item Properties**

1. Select the item or items whose properties you want to review.
2. Select **Edit** > Properties to display the **Properties** window.
3. Enter or edit information in the cell next to the appropriate property.

You can review and edit item properties in the **Engineering Data Editor**. You can edit the contents of some cells directly in the table if the corresponding property is not read-only or generated strictly by validation, or you can select an item by selecting the icon in the left-most column and then edit its properties in the **Properties** window.

For formatted properties, such as estimated length or maximum operating temperature, you can enter a value without a format. Use a single quote, ’, at the beginning of your entry. In this way, you can enter free text into a formatted property and no units of measurement are assigned.

**Associate an Item with a Plant Group**

When an item is placed in a drawing, the plant group type and the plant group name under which the drawing resides are assigned to the item by default. See Editing Plant Group Properties . To associate an item to a different plant group:

1. Select the item that you want to associate with a different plant group. The default plant group is the node in the plant hierarchy immediately under which the drawing resides.
2. In the **Properties** window, select the plant group type in the **Plant Group Type** property box.

Not all item types support the plant group property.

To associate your item with a different unit, modify the plant group name in the **Plant Group Name** property box.

If identical plant group names exist, holding the mouse pointer over a selected value from the list displays a tool tip showing the plant group hierarchy path for that value. Therefore, if two units named U1

are available in the list, displaying the tool tip will show the different paths for the names; for example

**\A1\U1** and **\A2\U1**.

**Customizing the Software**

Customization allows you to modify and enhance the software to meet your specific needs. You can use standard Windows programming tools and languages that are OLE-aware, such as Microsoft® Visual Basic®. Several ways to customize the software are available:

**Customizing with Built-In Commands**

You can add commands to a menu or a menu command to a toolbar. To add a button to a toolbar or a command to a menu, you select **Tools** > Customize. From there, you can select the **Menu** or Toolbars Tab

and select the options that you want. For example, if you frequently use the **View** > **Previous** command, you could add the **Previous View** button to the main toolbar. The **Previous View** button is listed on the

Toolbars Tab of the Customize Dialog.

If you want to create a new toolbar that does not exist in the software, you can start by selecting **View** > **Toolbars**. You then select **New** and type the name of the new toolbar on the **New Toolbar** dialog. After you select **OK**, the Customize Dialog automatically appears so that you can add buttons to the new toolbar.

**Customizing with Macros**

Not only can you add built-in commands or buttons to the software, but you can also create your own macros and add them to menus and toolbars in the same manner. The **Tools** > Customize command allows you to add macros to the standard menus and toolbars in the software. Or, you can run the macros directly by selecting **Tools** > Custom Commands and selecting the macro.

You can create the macros in Visual Basic or other OLE-aware programming applications. Some of the OLE-aware programming applications are Visual Basic for Applications, Visual C++ Delphi, Visual Basic, and so forth.

**Working with Drawings**

Drawing Manager is used to create a new drawing on a pre-formatted template. When you create and open a drawing, the drawing is displayed in a **Drawing** view in the **Design** window.

Drawings are graphical representations of plant models using standard symbols and conventions. A plant model consists of components. A component is any piece of equipment, instrumentation, piping, or other item used to create a plant model. Symbols represent components in **Catalog Explorer** and **Engineering** **Data Editor**. You select symbols from **Catalog Explorer** and then select the appropriate placement location in the drawing. In the **Properties** window, you enter appropriate values into the database for each property of the component. You can use the commands on toolbars and in menus to add information to your drawing, and you can use edit commands to modify the information in your drawing.

Any changes that you make to the drawing data are automatically saved in the database. You can also save drawings in different formats, including .pid for Smart P&ID, .dwg and .dxf for AutoCAD®, .dgn for MicroStation®, and .pdf format. You cannot save a drawing as a template. The only way to use a template is to have a plant administrator select a template at drawing creation in Drawing Manager.

The following table lists the characters that cannot be used in certain names, paths, passwords, or file names throughout Smart Engineering Manager and the Engineering and Schematics products.

**Using Templates as a Starting Point**

You use a template as a starting point for creating the drawing. A template is a file that provides tools such as text, geometry, dimensions, and drawing units, used to produce a new drawing. Your plant administrator can edit the property set of the template to include default values for some of the properties that you need to manage your drawings. The template that your plant administrator selects depends on the type of information that is wanted in the drawing.

Several standard templates are delivered with Smart P&ID, and you can create new templates in Smart P&ID. If you want to create custom border files for your drawing templates, use Intergraph SmartSketch.

You can then embed your border file in the new templates you create in Smart P&ID. After you embed a border file into a drawing template and a drawing is created in Drawing Manager using that template, any changes to the border file are not reflected in drawings created prior to the change. If you link a border file, instead of embedding it, and then subsequently change that border in SmartSketch, changes are reflected automatically in your drawing.

**Opening Existing Drawings**

The **Open** command on the **File** menu opens existing drawings. You can also change databases by using this command so that you can open drawings in other plants.

The software keeps track of the drawings that you worked on last. These drawings appear at the bottom of the **File** menu. To open one of these drawings, you can select it from that list. The **Options** command on the **Tools** menu allows you to set the number of entries displayed in that list.

**Setting Up Properties for a Drawing**

An administrator sets up drawing properties such as units of measure in Options Manager and Format Manager. The drawing information is stored in a database associated with the drawings in a plant.

With the **Properties** command on the **File** menu, you can view, edit, and save properties for a drawing.

Drawing properties can include the title, the author, and keywords that identify important information. These properties include drawing statistics, such as drawing size and the date that a drawing was created and last modified; the software updates statistics automatically. You can change the size of a drawing by using the **Page Setup** command on the **File** menu, and you can change the name of a drawing in Drawing Manager.

Renaming a drawing file in Windows allows the drawing to be opened with all graphics pointing to the database. However, renaming a drawing file in Windows does not update the drawing table in the plant schema where the drawing name is stored.

**Working with Several Open Drawings**

Several drawings can remain open in the same session but only if they all belong to the same plant. Each drawing can have more than one view, too. You can use the **Cut**, **Copy**, and **Paste** commands to move or copy information between the drawings or within one open drawing. You can use commands on the **Window** menu to arrange all the open drawings and views so that you can see them easily.

**Open > Smart P&ID Drawing Command (File Menu)**

Opens the **Open** dialog, which lists existing plants and their drawings. An administrator creates the hierarchy of plants and projects in Smart Engineering Manager.

**Open Dialog**

Displays the active plant hierarchy and lists its drawings, and allows you to open a drawing and to choose the database that you access. This dialog appears when you select **File** > **Open** > **Smart P&ID Drawing** on the main menu bar.

Pause over a toolbar button in order to display a ToolTip, which names the corresponding command.

**Open Database**

Opens the **Open Plant Structure** dialog, which allows you to specify a different initialization file so that you can work in a different database. You cannot open two drawings from different databases at the same time.

If you currently have a drawing open in Smart P&ID, the **Open Database** command is not available.

**Filter**

Opens the **Filter** dialog, which allows you to specify criteria for filtering the drawings that are displayed in the List view.

**Units Tab (File Properties Dialog)**

Sets up units of measure and precision readout for the length, area, or angle values in a drawing.

The precision readout sets the number of significant figures to appear. It represents the accuracy of the unit readout value. The precision setting does not alter the numbers that you type into a property, it alters only the display of the numbers. Values ending in 5 are rounded up. For example, if the precision readout is .123

and you draw a line that is 2.1056 inches long, then the line value length is rounded up to 2.106 inches.

**Length Readout**

Sets the unit of measure and precision readout for the length values in a document.

**Angle Readout**

Sets the unit of measure and precision readout for the angle values in a document.

**Area Readout**

Sets the unit of measure and precision readout for the area values in a document.

When placed on a drawing, all delivered labels that include units of measure use the plant default formats defined in Options Manager, and so labels do not always display the units of measure selected in the **Properties** window. To ensure that a label displays the units of measure specified in the **Properties** window, in **Catalog Manager**, select the required label, and from the **Format** list on the **SmartText Editor** dialog, select the **As Entered** option.

The software supports round-trip conversion of units without loss of precision. That is, you can convert centimeters to meters and back and retain the originally entered value of centimeters with no round-off loss.

To avoid loss of precision in units when switching between small and large types of a particular unit, increase the precision, that is, increase decimal places, of the larger unit through Format Manager.

**Creating Drawing Templates**

The software includes several standard drawing templates. You usually create a new drawing based on one of these existing templates; however, it is possible to customize a drawing template to meet your particular needs. This task is accomplished inside the design software by using commands on the **File** menu. The pre-defined size choices for a new template are extensive.

The default storage location for templates is specified in Options Manager (in the **PID Template Path** field of the **Settings** options). Templates saved in this default location will be available for all new drawings that you create.

The software also includes a set of title block labels that fit the delivered drawing templates. If you create a new template, you can also create a new title block label that fits the title block of your template correctly and that contains the appropriate information. You create labels in Catalog Manager.

If you want to create custom border files for your drawing templates, use Intergraph SmartSketch. You can then embed your border file in the new templates you create in Smart P&ID. After you embed a border file into a drawing template and a drawing is created in Drawing Manager using that template, any changes to the border file are not reflected in drawings created prior to the change. Drawing objects on the background sheet of the .igr file that you want to include in the border must be copied and placed on the working sheet using SmartSketch prior to inserting the .igr file into Smart P&ID. The border file must be inserted into the

‘DrawingBorder’ layer.

If you link a border file, instead of embedding it, and then subsequently change that border in SmartSketch, changes are reflected automatically in your drawing. When linking a border file, ensure that you set the **Windows File Explorer** property of the border file to **Read-only**.

SmartFrames and Title Block Label symbols are the only object types allowed in a template.

**Saving Drawings**

Whenever you save a drawing using **File** > **Save**, the software uses the name and folder location specified in Drawing Manager during drawing creation. If you want to save the drawing ina format other than .pid, use the **Save As** or **Save as PDF** command.

When you open an existing drawing, the software copies the drawing from the disk or network and displays it on the screen. As you work, the changes that you make to the drawing appear on your screen. These changes are saved in the database automatically.

If another user modifies an item on an open drawing using automation and you also modify the same item from Smart P&ID, on saving the drawing, you will receive a message that you must close and then reopen the drawing. All unsaved changes that you made to the drawing will be lost.

After you have saved a drawing, it remains displayed on the screen. You can use **File** > **Close** to close the drawing and clear it from your screen, or you can use **File** > **Exit** to close the drawing and quit the software.

**Saving Assemblies**

You can save a group of items in a drawing as an assembly. Assemblies are saved in a specific folder specified in Options Manager. You can retrieve assemblies from **Catalog Explorer** to place in a drawing.

**Saving Drawings in Other Formats**

You can save drawings to the following formats using the **Save As** command: **MicroStation (*.dgn)**

**AutoCAD (*.dwg)**

**AutoCAD (*.dxf)**

Smart P&ID uses the ExportLayer.xlsx file to map drawing item types to the layers that they will be assigned to. Filters are used to define the scope of the item type, for example ‘Equipment - New’ The file then specifies the layer to which the scoped item type will be assigned. If a symbol’s item type does not match any of the filter definitions and if that symbol is in the current drawing layer (Primary, Typical, or both), the symbol is saved in the Default layer. If a display set is assigned to the drawing and the **Color** value of filtered or background items is **None**, the software ignores the ExportLayer.xlsx file and those items go to the hidden layer in AutoCAD or MicroStation. If the **Color** value of filtered or https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

background items is not **None**, filtered items go to the layer specified by the filter and background items go to the default layer unless a filter exists in the ExportLayer.xlsx file for a particular item or set of items, in which case the settings in the ExportLayer.xlsx file override the display set settings for those background items.

Text boxes on drawings that are saved as AutoCAD drawings display a border if the fill color **Blank** is selected in the **Text Block Properties**. To remove the border around text boxes in translated AutoCAD drawings, modify the P&ID symbol in Catalog Manager and set the **Text Block Properties** fill color to **None**.

You can save drawings as PDF files using the **Save as PDF** command.

You can also batch save drawings in other formats in Drawing Manager. See *Save Drawings in Other* *Formats* in the Drawing Manager Help.

**Save a Drawing or a Drawing Template**

Select **Save** on the main toolbar.

If you have not named a template before saving, the **Save As** dialog appears. You can type a name and choose a format and location for your template.

The value of the **Override Layers on Export** attribute in the pidacad.ini file affects the output when saving a file as AutoCAD. If symbols are exported as blocks (when the value of the **Dissolve Symbol** **to Groups** attribute is set to 0), you must specify a value of 2 or 3 for the **Override Layers on Export** attribute to ensure that the blocks are exported to the correct AutoCAD layer. For full details of the **Override Layers on Export** attribute, see Configuration File Settings for AutoCAD Translation.

When saving to AutoCAD or MicroStation, the software checks the ExportLayer.xlsx file and if it finds a reference to a filter that does not exist in the reference data, a **Filters Not Found** dialog is displayed showing a list of missing filters. When you select **Exit** to dismiss the dialog, the save as process stops.

When saving to AutoCAD or MicroStation using a display set, the software uses the ExportLayer.xlsx file only for filtering items that do not meet any of the display set filter criteria and for which the **Color** value of filtered or background items is not **None**.

Text boxes on drawings that are saved as AutoCAD drawings display a border if the fill color **Blank** is selected in the **Text Block Properties**. To remove the border around text boxes in translated AutoCAD drawings, modify the P&ID symbol in Catalog Manager and set the **Text Block Properties** fill color to **None**.

When you save a drawing in .dwg format, the text labels appear in low-resolution due to the changes made to the text width factor in RAD.

When saving a drawing to AutoCAD with SmartFrame objects such as auxiliary graphics, you must do the following to prevent a border showing around such objects:

1. In the Smart P&ID installation folder path *..\Program Files (x86)\SmartPlant\P&ID*

*Workstation\bin*, select the pidacad.dwg seed file and copy it to a location where you have write https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

The number values are used in the linestyle table to map linestyle definitions in the current document to AutoCAD line types.

When you save a drawing in .dwg format, the text labels appear in low-resolution due to the changes made to the text width factor in RAD.

**Save a Drawing as a PDF File**

1. Select **File** > **Save as PDF**.
2. On the **Save as PDF** dialog, specify the resolution, color mode, JPEG compression, and whether or not to include inconsistency markers in the output.
3. Beside the **File path** box, select the ellipsis button

to navigate to the folder where you want to

save the PDF file and type a name for the file.

**Save as PDF Command (File Menu)**

Opens the Save as PDF Dialog, where you define the output settings and the file name and path for the current drawing to save it as a .pdf file.

**Save as PDF Dialog**

Allows you to define the output settings and the file name and path for drawings that you save as PDF files.

**Resolution**

Modifies the dots per inch, or “dpi”. The greater the dpi, the better the clarity. Increasing the resolution setting increases the file size and can slightly increase the time required to process some files.

**Color options**

**Color**

Creates a PDF using the colors available in the document. You can only create a color PDF from a color drawing sheet.

**Grayscale**

Creates a PDF using a 256-color grayscale.

**Pure black and white**

Creates a PDF that has no color or grayscale. Anything that is not pure white is drawn as black.

**JPEG compression**

Compresses images embedded in your document according to the compression level you define. If your drawing contains a lot of images, compression settings are very important for achieving good image quality at a manageable file size. Use the pull-down menu to set the compression level. Compression levels in the **High quality** range do not noticeably affect image quality, and produce larger file sizes than settings in the https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

**Low quality** range. However, using a mid-range compression level usually strikes the best balance in creating a compact file while still maintaining enough information to produce high-quality images.

**Include inconsistency markers**

When selected, includes inconsistency symbols that appear on the drawing in the PDF output.

**File path**

Allows you to define the name and path for the PDF file.

**Re-creating Drawings**

Smart P&ID continually updates the database as you edit a drawing. However, the drawing file is not updated until you actually save the file (that is, when you select **File** > **Save** or when you exit Smart P&ID).

Occasionally, the software might terminate abnormally due to power outages and so forth. As a result, the database is up-to-date with changes that you posted to the drawing, but the drawing file reflects the status when you last saved the drawing. When you re-open the drawing, the software recognizes that the drawing file is different from the database.

The software displays a message box that states: One or more items in this drawing are inconsistent with the database. Select **OK** to re-create the drawing from the database.’

During the re-create process, the status bar at the bottom of the main window keeps you informed about the particular elements currently reconciling with the database. Also, a log file, **Recreate-DrawingName.log**, is created in your **Temp** folder. You can check this file for irregularities that occur during the re-create process.

Do not interfere with the re-create process after it is started because the drawing can become unusable.

For best system performance, close all other applications except for Smart P&ID when running the recreate process.

During the re-create process the status bar at the bottom of the window displays updates about the particular elements currently being reconciled with the database. You can check the log file, Recreate[Drawing#].log, located in the Temp directory, for any problems that may have occurred during the re-create process.

If your reference data has changed, use the Update Drawings functionality to incorporate those changes into your existing drawings. See the Smart P&ID * * Drawing Manager Help.

After the re-create process finishes, Smart P&ID reinitializes the drawing and displays the message ‘Recreate drawing is complete’. Review the re-created drawing and resolve any errors that occurred.

**Error Conditions**

If a section of the drawing could not re-create successfully, an error condition appears on the drawing as a heavy line segment that is highlighted orange by default. Error conditions are almost always associated with a pipe or signal run and must be resolved manually.

1. Delete the heavy orange line segment and components directly connected to it.
2. Re-route the line runs and replace all connections and components as required.

**Orphaned Drawing Symbols and Band-Aiding**

An orphaned drawing symbol is a symbol for which no properties appear in the **Properties** window when the symbol is selected. This occurs because the symbol is missing from the database. On opening a drawing which is in a re-create state and contains orphaned symbols, a message appears prompting you either to recreate or to band-aid the missing symbols. Selecting **OK** will automatically delete orphaned symbols in the drawing. To band aid the symbols, select **Cancel**. The next time you open the drawing, the message will appear again and the symbols will be band-aided. Band-aided symbols are indicated by heavy orange lines.

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

It is not possible simply to delete orphaned symbols manually from a drawing. You must do one of the following to fix orphaned symbols:

1. Open the drawing using Smart P&ID Automation (for symbols in a re-create state). For details, see Fix Orphaned Symbols During Drawing Re-Creation in the *Smart P&ID Utilities Guide*.
2. Use the OrphanGraphics.dll macro (for symbols not in a re-create state). For details, see Fix Orphaned Symbols Using the OrphanGraphics Macro in the *Smart P&ID Utilities Guide*.

**Re-create a Drawing**

1. Open the drawing that you want to re-create.
2. Set a heat trace medium for an item in the drawing.
3. Right-click an empty space on your Windows taskbar, and then select **Task Manager**.
4. Select the **Processes** tab.
5. In the list, select **draft.exe**.
6. Select **End Process**.
7. In Smart P&ID, open the drawing that you opened in step 1.
8. When the software prompts you that a re-create is necessary, select **OK** to re-create the drawing from the database.
9. Remove the heat trace medium that you set in step 2.
10. Save the drawing.

Normally Smart P&ID re-creates drawings automatically when it detects a discrepancy between the drawing and the database.

For more information about re-creating drawings, see the **Re-creating Drawings** section in the Smart P&ID Installation and Upgrade Help.

**Resolve a Re-create Drawing Error Condition**

1. Delete all connectors and components that are directly connected to the error condition.
2. Delete the heavy orange lines that make up the error itself.
3. Re-route your pipe or signal run.

Keep property breaks in mind as you re-route your lines.

1. Replace connectors and components that you deleted in step 1.

Error conditions are not required items and therefore do not move to the stockpile when you delete them.

**Using Filters**

You can use filters in many ways throughout the software and its stand-alone applications and utilities.

You can use filters when you create report templates to display particular items on a report. You can use filters in Rule Manager to define how items interact within a view. You can associate filters with the source or target properties in rules. You can also use filters to find and replace items.

You can create filters to control the display of hierarchy items in Drawing Manager. These filters are not saved to any folder in Filter Manager, but the methods of creating these filters are the same as those for creating filters saved in Filter Manager.

If you are using a Workshare environment and you are at a satellite site, do not create Project Filters at a satellite site. However, you can always create My Filters in the Filter Manager or **Select Filter** dialog environment.

**New Filter Dialog**

Allows you to specify compound or simple filter when you create a new filter. You activate this dialog by selecting **New** on the **Select Filter** dialog.

**Compound filter**

Combines two or more simple filters to return a collection of items based on the criteria of the combination of simple filters.

**Simple filter**

Returns a collection of items based on the filter definition and criteria of a single filter.

**Filter Properties Dialog**

Specifies properties of a filter, including the name, description, and the other properties for which you want to filter. Each item type owns a set of properties. Examples of item types are **Equipment**, and **Instrument**, and examples of properties for these item types are **Equipment Type**, **InstrLoop Part Number**, and **Estimated Length** respectively.

**Name**

Specifies the filter name. The name can be any combination of characters and any length. Filter names within a plant must be unique. This name appears as the filter name on the Filter Manager interface.

**Set as asking filter**

Select this check box to define the filter as an asking filter. When an asking filter is invoked on its own or as part of a display set, you are prompted to change the values in the **Operator** and **Value** fields for the filter properties. Clear the check box to define the filter as a regular simple filter.

**Description**

Allows you to specify a phrase or sentence about the filter. The description can be any combination of characters and any length. The description appears as a ToolTip when you point to the filter name on the Filter Manager interface.

**Filter for**

Contains the top-level items from the Data Dictionary. This area allows you to specify available properties in the **Definition** grid.

**Definition**

Displays all defined criteria associated with a filter. To add to or modify the definition list, you must select a line in the list and then define or edit the property in the **Edit** group.

**Match all**

Specifies that only items matching ALL of the filtering criteria pass through the filter.

**Match any**

Specifies that items matching any one or more of the filtering criteria pass through the filter. **Match any** is the default matching method.

**Add**

Places a new entry at the end of the existing definition list and enables the options in the **Edit** group so you can edit the new entry.

**Delete**

Removes the selected criterion from the definition list. This button is available only when you select a criterion in the definition list.

**Edit**

Allows you to define or edit a single line of filter definition criteria.

**Property**

Displays a list of all properties for a certain item type. Examples of properties include **Equipment Type**, **Instrument Loop Item Tag**, and **Estimated Length**. You define or modify filtering criteria by selecting a property, an operator, and a value.

**Operator**

Specifies the relationship between the property and its value. Examples of relationships include greater than (>), equal to (=), and not equal to (<>).

If a string property is being filtered or a wildcard character is being used, only the ‘equal to’ (=) operator is valid as a selection. When a wildcard character is used, the ‘equal to’ operator actually behaves as a ‘like’ operator.

**Value**

Lists appropriate values for the property specified in the **Property** list. If a list of attributes is not already associated with the **Value** box, you must type a value, which can be free text, or choose null. You can use a percent sign (**%**) as a wildcard character to find multiple characters or an underscore (_) as a wildcard character for a single character. Do not use an asterisk (*****) in the **Value** box.

If you are defining the **Engineering Data Editor**, the criteria that you enter on the **Filter** tab on the **Advanced View Properties** dialog are combined with the base filter that you select.

**Add Compound Filter / Compound Filter Properties Dialog**

A compound filter consists of more than one simple filter. Simple filters are added to the compound filter by dragging the simple filter to the compound filter folder or by creating new simple filters under the compound filter in the filter hierarchy. Compound filters apply only to homogeneous item types. This dialog specifies the properties of a compound filter, including the name, description, and whether to match all or any of the simple filter criteria.

**Name**

Specifies the filter name. The name can be any combination of characters and has no length limit. Filter names within a plant must be unique. This name appears as the filter name in the Filter Manager interface.

**Description**

Specifies a phrase or sentence about the filter. The description can be any combination of characters and has no length limit. The description appears as a ToolTip when you point to the filter name in the Filter Manager interface.

**Filter method**

Allows you to decide whether items must meet all or only one criterion to pass through the filter.

**Match all**

Specifies that items matching ALL of the filtering criteria pass through the filter.

**Match any**

Specifies that items matching any one or more of the filtering criteria pass through the filter. **Match any** is the default matching method.

**Select Filter Dialog**

Defines options for items using definitions associated with a filter. Using this dialog, you can create a new filter or modify an existing filter. Filters can also be automatically created using the **Create Auto Display** **Set** command. The auto filters created are shown in the **Auto Filters** folder that appears under the **Plant** **Folders**.

In Smart P&ID Options Manager, this dialog displays when you define options for a new symbology or gapping priorities.

**New**

Displays the **New Filter** dialog, which allows you to specify a new simple or compound filter.

**Properties**

Allows you to edit the properties of the selected filter. This button displays the **Filter Properties** dialog or the **Compound Filter Properties** dialog, depending on your selection in the filter list. If you create a compound filter, select the individual simple filters that comprise a compound filter, and select **Properties** to view the **Filter Properties** dialog for those simple filters.

**Creating P&IDs in Smart P&ID**

With Smart P&ID, you can easily perform the tasks required to create a detailed plant model. You can place components such as equipment, piping, and instrumentation from **Catalog Explorer** or the stockpile into graphical representations of your plant model in the drawing. Smart P&ID provides multiple views of a central, unified data structure that represents the plant model. The plant model is the computer representation of the conceptual design in its entirety, including all plant components and their relationships.

By manipulating model views, you can organize the information within the plant model to better understand and maintain the data. A view is a visual presentation of the data that composes the plant model. A view can be a schematic drawing, a table, or a report.

One key feature of Smart P&ID is using catalogs to create instances of components within the plant model.

The standard modeling environment lets you place items from the catalog into the appropriate model views.

If you repeatedly place particular groups of items, you can save the group of items as an assembly.

Assemblies appear as symbols in the **Catalog Explorer** **List** view so you can place them exactly as you place other symbols in your **List**.

In the **Properties** window, you can add values for various properties of each item after you place it in your drawing. You can also annotate your drawing with labels as you design the drawing.

As you work on your drawing, you can monitor any inconsistencies in your design by reviewing the inconsistency indicators. These indicators appear in your drawing as soon as an inconsistency occurs in the design. You can resolve inconsistencies using solutions from the **Consistency Check** dialog.

Additionally, you can generate reports to help you keep track of information in the drawing. For example, after you finish the drawing, you can generate order lists for the components in the drawing. You can print the drawing, if necessary.

**Properties Window**

Allows you to add values for various properties of each item after you place it in your drawing. Also, you can annotate your drawing with labels as you design the drawing.

**Reporting**

Reports help you keep track of information in the drawing. For example, after you finish the drawing, you can generate order lists for the components in the drawing.

**Display Sets**

Display sets allow you to control the display of the model in the Drawing view. Display sets use filters that control which symbols you want to display. You can use these filters to print a subset of the entire drawing or to specify layers and colors for drawing items when saving to AutoCAD or MicroStation.

Display sets can be created manually or automatically. For the display sets you create, you can define filters, colors and widths for the display items, while for auto display sets, filters are automatically created with colors and widths defined, that you can modify as required.

You can save filters and share them with other users working in the same plant.

**Understanding Database Constraints**

The following database constraints improve the integrity of the data associated with your design.

**Foreign Key**

Insures that the corresponding value, unless it is null, exists in the table referenced by the foreign key. This type of constraint is used to enforce logical relationships, such as the plant item to plant group relationship.

**Foreign Key** in conjunction with **Not Null**

Enforces group relationships, such as the case to model item relationship. This constraint is similar to the **Foreign Key** constraint described above but does not allow null values to persist.

**Foreign Key** with **Not Null** and **Unique**

138/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Enforce all subclass and one-to-one relationships, such as the pairing of OPCs. This constraint is similar to the **Foreign Key** constraint described above but does not allow null values to persist and requires that all values be unique.

The constraints so far described serve to enforce relationship integrity. Because the relationship, the object, and the foreign key it points to, already exists in the database or is created during your transaction, the constraints are satisfied without changing the scope of your transaction.

**Check**

Used for more complex data integrity controls, such as monitoring conditions on multiple items. For example, History records can pertain to either a drawing or the model. Either of these objects can be null, but not both of them. A **Check** constraint enforces this condition by using comparisons and exclusions.

Another candidate for a **Check** constraint is the enforcement of certain values for one or more items. For example, invalid null or zeros assigned to properties are tested against **Check** constraints.

**Selecting Drawing Items**

To select an item, you can use the **Select Tool** on the main toolbar. You can select pipe routes, equipment, valves, labels, and so forth, and you can select item groups, assemblies, or embedded or linked objects.

**Selecting Single Items**

To select an item, select the **Select Tool**

on the main toolbar. When you select the **Select Tool**, the

pointer changes to an arrow with a locate zone indicator at the end:

. As you pause on items in a

drawing, the items appear in the highlight color. When an item is highlighted, select to select it.

When you select an individual item, the following things happen:

The item changes to the selection color. You can change the selection color with the **Tools** > **Options** command.

The handles of the item appear if the item has handles. Handles are solid squares at significant positions on a selected item, such as end points and center points. Handles allow you to directly modify the item, such as dragging a handle to change the shape of the item. Although you can select more than one item at a time, only one item can have handles at a time.

If the item is linked or embedded into the current drawing, selecting it allows you to double-click it for editing.

You can also select drawing items by first selecting them in the **Engineering Data Editor**. The corresponding items are selected in the Drawing view if they reside in the active drawing.

**Selecting Multiple Items**

You can select more than one item at a time by selecting **Select Tool** and then holding CTRL or SHIFT

as you select the items that you want to select. Additionally, you can use the **Select Tool** and then drag to https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

fence items.

When you select multiple items or grouped items, the items change to the selection color.

You can use the Select Tool Ribbon to choose if you want to select only items completely enclosed by the

fence or any item that is partly enclosed by the fence. Many manipulation commands, like **Delete**, **Move**, **Copy**, and **Rotate**, can act upon all items in the select set.

You can also use **Polygon Fence Locate**

to create a polygon shaped fence to select multiple items.

If you select multiple items in the **Engineering Data Editor**, these items are also selected in the active drawing, if they reside there. You construct a select set using the **Engineering Data Editor** in this way.

Whenever you have constructed a select set, you can choose single items from that set by using the **Selected Items** list at the top of the **Properties** window. A single item chosen in a select set this way is highlighted in a different color in the Drawing view.

**Canceling the Selection of Items**

To cancel the selection of an item or group of items, select any empty point on the drawing.

**Selecting Items for Placement**

To place an item in a drawing, you select it in **Catalog Explorer** or the stockpile. Then you click to select the position in the drawing to place the item. You cannot select more than one item for placement in a drawing at a time. After placement, you can select another item or press ESC to quit placement mode. Or, you can escape placement mode by right-clicking.

**Select Tool Command**

Changes the pointer to the arrow-shaped selection pointer so you can select, modify, and manipulate items. The circle at the end of the pointer arrow is the locate zone. While the **Select Tool** is active, the **Select Tool** ribbon is displayed.

**Select Tool Ribbon**

The **Select Tool Ribbon** displays when nothing is selected. After you select an item, the **Select Tool** ribbon is replaced with a ribbon for editing the selected item.

**Inside**

Specifies that elements inside the fence are selected.

**Overlapping**

Specifies that elements overlapped by the fence are selected, as well as elements inside the fence.

**Bottom Up**

Specifies that individual elements in a group are located as opposed to the whole group.

**Mouse Gesture**

When toggled down, specifies that when placing a fence from left to right, items inside the fence are selected, while when placing a fence from right to left, items both overlapped by the fence and inside the fence are selected. The direction of fence placement automatically toggles the **Inside** / **Overlapping** option to match the mode of selection of the items.

To find out the name of an option on the ribbon, pause the pointer over an option and read the ToolTip.

**Polygon Fence Locate Command**

Creates a select set by drawing a rectangular or polygonal fence around objects based on points that you define.

Select to place the first point, select the remaining points to define the rectangle or polygon. Points are placed when you release the mouse button. Right-select to end the fence. When the **Polygon Fence** tool is active, the **Polygon Fence** ribbon is displayed.

**Polygon Fence Ribbon**

**Rectangle**

Creates a select area, or fence, by drawing a rectangle around points that you define. When you drag the mouse to define a rectangular fence, a dashed rectangular outline dynamically appears as you drag. When you reach the preferred size, release the mouse button to create the fence. The dashed fence outline disappears and the elements are selected.

**Polygon**

Creates a select area, or fence, by drawing a polygon around points that you define. Select to place the first point, select the remaining points to define the polygon. Points are placed when you release the mouse button. Right-click to end the polygon. The dotted outline disappears and the elements are selected.

**Inside**

1. When the appropriate orientation displays, select the corresponding button on the **Configuration** tool to place the item in that orientation.

Right-click in an empty portion of the drawing or press ESC to close the **Configuration** tool.

**Placing Items on a Grid**

The grid and its lines allow you to place items in the drawing by aligning them with the grid lines or nearest intersection of the grid lines. You can use the grid if you want the items to line up at regular intervals in the drawing.

The grid is a set of imaginary lines in the drawing; they do not appear when you print the drawing. When you select **View** > **Snap grid**, items always align with the grid lines or nearest intersection of the grid lines.

You can view the grid by selecting **View** > **Show grid**.

You can change the display of the grid from static to dynamic by setting options on the **Grid** tab of the **View** **Properties** dialog. To view grid lines at a finer level, set the style to dynamic and adjust the density.

The grid lines for a dynamic grid move as you zoom in or out in a view. You can set dynamic grid lines to appear at fine, medium, or coarse levels. The grid lines appear at common major measurement increments.

A dynamic grid displays index lines that intersect with the darker, solid grid lines.

A static grid displays solid grid lines that do not move as you zoom in or out. You can specify the increment settings on the **Grid** tab of the **View Properties** dialog.

You do not have to display the grid in order to snap items to it.

**Show Grid Command (View Menu)**

Displays a grid so you can place items with precision. The grid is not considered part of the drawing and does not print.

You can change the grid display from static to dynamic by setting options on the **Grid** tab of the **View Properties** dialog, which opens when you select **View** > **Properties**.

**Snap Grid Command (View Menu)**

Aligns items with the grid. The grid is a set of lines in the drawing background that helps you align items.

When you set the **Snap grid** option, items always align with the grid lines or nearest intersection of the grid lines. Grid lines do not print.

You can change the grid display by setting options on the **Grid** tab of the **View Properties** dialog, which opens when you select **View** > **Properties**. To view grid lines at a finer level, set the style to **Dynamic** and adjust the grid line width with the **Density** control.

**Placing Equipment**

You can place various types of equipment in your drawing, such as towers, boilers, heat exchangers, and reactors. You also place equipment components in drawings. Equipment components are items associated with pieces of equipment, such as nozzles and trays.

As you place equipment components, the software automatically creates a group relationship between the equipment and the component. As a group, the components move when you move the equipment.

However, you can only associate an equipment component with a single piece of equipment. When you place an equipment component, the component is associated with the last selected or highlighted piece of equipment, creating an equipment group.

Depending on the rules defined for the equipment or equipment component, you can have limits to the possible placements for the equipment. For example, specific trays can be flagged for placement inside the piece of equipment, and nozzles can be flagged for placement outside the piece of equipment. Rule Manager defines rules that determine the way that model items interact during manipulation.

The software includes a standard group of equipment and equipment component symbols. However, you or your plant administrator can change and add to these symbols as needed for your plant.

**Place Equipment**

1. In the **Catalog Explorer** list view, select the equipment that you want to place.
2. Drag the item to the appropriate place in the drawing.
3. Position the item and release to place it.

In addition, you can select the item in the **Catalog Explorer** list view and then click the appropriate point in the drawing to place the item. Press ESC to quit placement mode. Or, you can escape placement mode by right-clicking.

1. In the **Properties** window, enter values for the equipment properties in the appropriate rows in the table.

You can assign heat tracing to equipment. See Assign Heat Tracing to an Item.

After you place items, you can mirror, rotate, or move most items using their component handles. See

Mirror an Item About an Existing Mirror Axis or Linear Element

Rotate an Item Using Its Rotate Handle

Move an Item Using the Move Button

If the **Properties** window is not displayed, you can display it by selecting the item and then selecting **Edit** > **Properties** on the main menu bar.

**Flanged Nozzle-Internal**, **Nozzle-Internal**, and **Pump Nozzle-Internal** can all be placed internally (for example, in a tank). You can use the same steps for placing equipment. For internal placement of equipment, you drag the nozzle to the interior of a tank and place it. If you want the nozzle opening facing to the right, approach the tank from the right when placing the nozzle. In other words, the opening of the nozzle will be placed in the direction that you approach the tank during placement.

If you need to place a nozzle so that it is associated with equipment but not attached to it, you can do the following:

1. Attach the nozzle to the equipment that you want it related to.
2. Select the nozzle.
3. While holding down the ALT key, drag the nozzle an arbitrary distance away from the equipment.

**Placing Multiple Representations**

A multiple representation allows the depiction of an item from another drawing in a detailed or alternate view. For example, a large vessel may be depicted on two drawings; one displaying the upper part and the other the lower part of the vessel. There is only one data record for the multiple representations, meaning that if you change one item of data, it is updated on all drawings. For data that is shown on labels on other drawings, they will be updated upon entering the other drawings or performing an update of out-of-date drawings. Until then the other drawings will be shown as out of date with respect to “Out of date model items”.

**Place Multiple Representations**

1. Open a drawing and place an item of equipment.
2. Save your work and exit the drawing.
3. Open the drawing that is a target for your multiple representation of an item. Be sure the drawing used in step 1 is closed.
4. On the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar, select **Other Drawings** .

1. Locate the item and then select it.

From the list, select a filter that best describes the type of item you want to represent. For example, select **Equipment**.

You can also open an **Engineering Data Editor** view of your target drawing in the **Design** window by selecting **Window** > **New** > **Engineering Data Editor**.

1. On the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar, select **Actions** > **Place Multiple Representation**.
2. In the Drawing view, select the location where you need to place the multiple representation.

You can use the **Replace** command or the **Find and Replace** dialog to replace a multiple representation symbol providing the definition attributes for the all the representations are identical.

The definition attributes are **Equipment Class**, **Equipment SubClass**, and **Equipment Type**.

You are permitted only a single representation of an item in any one drawing.

If you are working in a project, be aware that multiple representations are constrained because of claiming and moving drawings between projects and the Plant.

**Routing Lines**

Whether you are routing pipe or signal lines, you can manipulate all lines by using the same basic procedures. After you select a type of line route from the **Catalog Explorer** list view, use the commands on the **Line Routing** ribbon to help construct or modify the line.

Lines consist of a series of line segments. The software places handles, represented by black squares or dots, at each segment vertex along the line route. You can use these vertex handles to move, reroute, or connect lines. You can add vertices to add segments to the line using the commands on the **Line Routing** ribbon.

The software also provides a shortcut menu associated with lines. Right-click a line and choose from several commands. You use this menu to break runs or join runs. You can also use this menu to construct select sets of pipe runs.

**Line Connectivity**

When a new pipe run is placed such that it connects to existing pipe runs at either end, those pipe runs are automatically joined together if they have the same properties. The symbol placement command creates a new line when an inline component is placed directly up against an existing nozzle or other inline component. The pipe run created in this way has a zero length connector that attaches the two symbols.

Pipe runs that only have zero length connectors are aggressively joined up with the pipe runs they attach to; the properties for pipe runs with zero length connectors need not match. The zero length pipe run that gets created when one inline component is placed directly up against another inline component is automatically joined to the existing pipe run, too. When a new pipe run is placed that starts or ends at a component that belongs to an existing pipe run, the new pipe run is automatically joined with the existing pipe run. When a new pipe run is placed that starts or ends at the endpoint of an existing connector, the two pipe runs are joined and the new connector is actually merged with the existing connector. The automatic joining takes place in the same way for both placement and modification of connectors. At the time that the connection is made, the two pipe runs are tested for compatibility. If they pass the property criteria, they are automatically joined together.

If two pipe runs have different properties, they are not automatically joined together. If you want them joined together, the **Join Runs** command is still available for this purpose. Of course when two pipe runs with differing properties are joined into one, the properties of the surviving pipe run are retained and the others https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

are lost. Similarly, if you must define two different properties for two parts of a single pipe run, then the pipe run must be broken. The **Break Run** command is still available for this purpose.

Pipe runs always consist of a linear sequence of members and never include any branches. Placing a pipe run that branches off of an existing pipe run does not cause them to be joined together. Reducers are always located at the end of a pipe run and never in the middle. Placing a new pipe run that connects to a reducer does not result in the pipe runs being joined.

**Auto Join**

Pipe runs are automatically joined together whenever possible. When a new pipe run is placed, and it connects to existing pipe runs at either end, those pipe runs are automatically joined together if they have the same attribute values. Pipe runs that only have zero length connectors are joined with the pipe runs they attach to. (The attribute values for pipe runs with zero length connectors do not need to match.) This means that both the bottom-up and the top-down approaches produce the same final result.

When a new pipe run is placed that starts or ends at a component that belongs to an existing pipe run, the new pipe run is automatically joined with the existing pipe run. When a new pipe run is placed that starts or ends at the endpoint of an existing connector, the two pipe runs are joined and the new connector is actually merged with the existing connector.

The automatic joining takes place in the same way for both placement and modification of connectors. At the time the connection is made the two pipe runs are tested for compatibility. If they pass the attribute criteria, they are automatically joined together. The zero length pipe run that is created when one inline component is placed directly up against another inline component is automatically joined to the existing pipe run.

Pipe runs always consist of a linear sequence of members and never include any branches. Placing a pipe run that branches off of an existing pipe run does not cause them to be joined together.

Reducers are always located at the end of a pipe run and never in the middle. Placing a new pipe run that connects to a reducer does not result in the pipe runs being joined.

If two pipe runs have different attribute values, they are not automatically joined together. If you want them joined, the **Join Runs** command is to be used. When two pipe runs with differing attribute values are joined into one, the attributes of the surviving pipe run are retained and the others are discarded. Similarly, if you must define two different attribute values for two parts of a single pipe run, then the pipe run must be broken. The **Break Run** command is used.

All of the above information about pipe runs also applies to signal runs.

**Line Routing Ribbon**

Appears when you select a line element from the **Catalog Explorer** list view or the **Engineering Data** **Editor** or when you select an existing line in a drawing. You can dock the **Line Routing** ribbon in the main toolbar; it remains there for the current design session unless you move it again.

Smart P&ID allows pipe runs to be associated with a different plant group other than the one the drawing resides in. If you break the pipe run by inserting a break component such as a reducer, both pipe runs will retain the original value of the Plant Group ID property (it is not changed to the plant group the drawing resides in).

**Join Runs Command**

**Line Shortcut Menu > Join Runs**

Enables you to join two lines together into one pipe run. After selecting this command from the **Line** shortcut menu, click on the line that you want to join to the selected line.

**Join Pipe Runs**

1. In the drawing, right-click the first pipe run that you want to join.
2. On the shortcut menu, select **Join Runs**.
3. In the drawing, click the second pipe run to join the two runs.

If you join two pipe runs with different properties, the resulting pipe run has the properties of the pipe run according to the routing (left to right or right to left) if both pipe runs have the same number of components. However, if the pipe runs have an unequal number of components, the software copies the properties from the pipe run with the greater number of components to the pipe run with the fewer number of components.

For information about breaking runs, see Break a Pipe Run.

You can change values for the properties of the new run by clicking the pipe run and then entering the values in the appropriate rows in the **Properties** window. If the **Properties** window does not appear, you can display it by clicking the line and then selecting **Edit > Properties** on the main menu bar.

You can also join pipe runs via automation. For more information, select **Start > Programs >** **Intergraph Smart P&ID > Programming Help** and see the Logical Model Automation Reference topic.

**Assigning Heat Tracing and Jacketing**

In Smart P&ID, you can assign heat tracing to pipe runs and to certain other plant items. The following types of heat tracing can be assigned:

Single heat trace

Double heat trace

Jacketed heat trace

The general workflow for making heat trace definitions is as follows: 1. Define heat trace media in Data Dictionary Manager by adding entries to the **Heat Trace Medium** select list.

1. Define the line style of each heat trace medium on the Options Manager **Tracing** tab.
2. Define the type of heat tracing on the Options Manager **Settings** tab by doing one of the following: For a single heat trace, ensure that the heat trace medium does not appear beside **Heat Tracing** **Media - Double Heat Trace** or **Heat Tracing Media - Jacketed Pipe**.

For a double heat trace, assign the heat trace medium to **Heat Tracing Media - Double Heat** **Trace**.

For a jacketed heat trace, assign the heat trace medium to **Heat Tracing Media - Jacketed** **Pipe**.

The implementation and positioning of heat trace or jacketing graphics depends on the heat tracing type and whether the heat tracing is applied to a pipe run or some other item type. The following table summarizes the behavior.

**Type of Heat Tracing**

**Behavior when Applied to Pipe Run**

**Behavior when Applied to Other Item Types**

Single

As defined by the selected default placement on the

Displays graphics from the **Heat Trace** layer of the symbol defined in Catalog Manager (same appearance as for single heat trace).

Jacketed

Heat tracing is placed on both sides of the pipe run.

Displays graphics from the **Jacket** layer of the symbol defined in Catalog Manager.

If, in Catalog Manager, no graphics are defined on the **Heat Trace** layer of a symbol, no heat trace will be displayed for the symbol in the drawing if a single or double heat trace is assigned and the item type of the symbol is anything other than Pipe Run.

If, in Catalog Manager, no graphics are defined on the **Jacket** layer of a symbol, no heat trace will be displayed for the symbol in the drawing if a jacketed heat trace is assigned and the item type of the symbol is anything other than Pipe Run.

If, in Catalog Manager, the item type of the symbol is Pipe Run, any graphics defined on the **Heat** **Trace** or **Jacket** layers are ignored.

In the drawing, the heat tracing line style of the selected heat trace medium for *all* item types is determined by the definition made on the Options Manager **Tracing** tab.

If a heat tracing medium that has been designated as jacketed is assigned to a *pipe run* in Smart P&ID, additional jacketed properties are displayed in the **Properties** window under the **Piping Jacket** category for that pipe run. If the heat trace medium is removed from the pipe run or is changed to something other than a jacketed heat trace, the **Piping Jacket** category and the associated properties are no longer displayed, and any values assigned to those properties are removed. In Data Dictionary Manager, you can add more jacketed properties if more are needed.

In Insulation Manager, you can define a heat trace medium to automatically be assigned with a particular insulation spec for a pipe run or equipment. Only the defined heat trace medium can be used in combination with that insulation spec. You can also choose one of the following options: **Undefined**

No heat trace can be used if that particular insulation spec is assigned.

**Ignore**

Any heat trace can be used with that specified insulation spec.

1. Select **Save**.

The actual style of the heat tracing graphics displayed in the drawing depends on the line style chosen for the specified heat trace medium in Options Manager. See Create a New Heat Tracing Medium.

**Modify the Offset Distance of Heat Trace Lines**

The heat trace line offset is modified by setting the offset value in the line style properties for an individual heat trace. The offset value has to be modified for every heat trace line style for which the offset change is required. The workflow is as follows:

1. Create a new symbol in Catalog Manager to be used to edit the line style and import the changes back into the ProjectStyles.spp file.
2. Reference the ProjectStyles.spp file.
3. Import line styles to be edited from the ProjectStyles.spp file into the symbol file and setting the offset to the needed value using Line Style Editor.
4. Import the updated line style from the symbol file back into the ProjectStyles.spp file in Options Manager.
5. Update drawings in Drawing Manager.

Unlike the default offset distance, a user-defined additional heat trace offset distance will not change dynamically as the zoom level changes in the Smart P&ID drawing view. It is recommended to turn on the **Display as printed** option (**Tools** > **Options** > **General**) in Smart P&ID to get a consistent look for the offset. This limitation will not affect the print-out results of the drawings.

This procedure has no impact on the heat trace line offset in translation output files (.dwg / .dxf / .dgn) created by the Smart P&ID **Save As** feature.

**Assign Heat Tracing to an Item**

1. Select the pipe run, piping component, equipment, equipment component, nozzle, or instrument for which you want to specify heat tracing.
2. In the **Properties** window, specify values for the **HT Medium**, **HT Medium Temp**, and **HT**

**Requirement** properties.

If you have already specified insulation properties for the item, you cannot subsequently assign heat tracing properties unless the default heat trace medium was set to **Ignore** for the specified insulation spec.

If you assign heat tracing to an item before you assign insulation properties, your choices of insulation properties and specifications are restricted.

The **HT Medium** and **HT Requirement** properties are available from select lists. When you type the temperature value for the **HT Medium Temp** property, the software associates the default unit of measure with the value unless you specify a different unit of measure. Select list values are defined in Data Dictionary Manager; Format Manager contains definitions for temperature units.

The location of the heat tracing graphics for piping components, equipment, equipment components, nozzles, or instruments is determined using the **Heat Trace** layer in C**atalog Manager**.

In Options Manager, you can define the heat trace symbology. You can also specify whether a particular heat trace medium is defined as a single or a double heat trace. This affects the way the symbology is applied, as shown in the following examples.

Pipe run, valve and nozzle with single heat trace medium:

Pipe run, valve and nozzle with double heat trace medium:

Note that the double heat trace definition affects the symbology of the *pipe run* only.

**Create a New Jacketed Property for Pipe Runs**

Jacketed properties are those properties that appear under the **Piping Jacket** category. Jacketed properties that come shipped with the software have the **J_** prefix; however, you can also create new jacketed properties if needed.

1. In Data Dictionary Manager, **Pipe Run** n the **Database Tables** tab.
2. Select **Edit** > **Add Property**.
3. On the **Add Property** dialog, enter all the information as needed. For the **Display Name** value, you might want to use the **J_** prefix or some other identifier to identify the property as jacketed.
4. Beside **Category**, select **Piping Jacket** from the list.
5. Select **OK** to close the **Add Property** dialog.
6. On the toolbar, select **Save** .

For a pipe run, the **Piping Jacket** category and all properties created under the **Piping Jacket** category are only displayed in the **Properties** window when a **Jacketed** heat tracing value is assigned to the item in the **Properties** window.

**Assign a Jacketed Heat Trace to an Item**

1. Select the pipe run, piping component, equipment, equipment component, nozzle, or instrument that you want to specify as being jacketed.
2. In the **Properties** window, select a value for the **HT Medium** that is defined as jacketing.
3. Select values for the **HT Medium Temp** and **HT Requirement** properties.
4. For a pipe run, enter values for the piping jacket properties, which begin with **J_**.

For a pipe run, if you have already specified insulation properties, you cannot subsequently assign jacketed pipe properties unless the default heat trace medium was set to **Ignore** for the specified insulation spec.

If you define a pipe run as jacketed, you can no longer assign values for regular insulation properties and specifications. If you want to specify insulation property values for the jacketed pipe, you must assign those values using the properties that have the **J_** prefix, which apply only to a jacketed pipe run.

The **HT Medium** and **HT Requirement** properties are available from select lists. When you type the temperature value for the **HT Medium Temp** property, the software associates the default unit of measure with the value unless you specify a different unit of measure. Select list values are defined in Data Dictionary Manager; Format Manager contains definitions for temperature units.

The location of the jacketed graphics for piping components, equipment, equipment components, nozzles, or instruments is determined using the **Jacket** layer in **Catalog Manager**.

Options Manager contains the symbology definitions and settings for defining the heat trace medium as a pipe jacket. This affects the way the symbology is applied to items. In the following example, graphics were added to the **Jacket** layer in **Catalog Manager** for the inline valve only, therefore jacketed symbology is displayed only for the valve and the pipe run, but not for the nozzle and the vessel.

When you select a nominal diameter value for a pipe run, the software assigns the minimum value for the jacket nominal diameter (as defined on the **Pipe Jacket Nominal Diameter** dialog table in Options Manager) to the **J_Nominal Diameter** property of the pipe jacket. Also, the software only allows combinations of core pipe nominal diameter and pipe jacket diameter that are consistent with the values in the table.

**Using Piping Components**

Piping components are graphic elements that represent processes or functions within a particular piping segment. Piping components include valves, flanges, reducers, and strainers. In drawings, piping components are connected with lines.

Generally, piping components automatically orient themselves when you drag them near an existing pipe segment. For example, if you drag a horizontal valve to a vertical pipe, the valve automatically orients itself vertically. If several possible orientations exist for the piping component, you can use the Configuration (QuickPick) tool to review the possible placements for the component and select a final orientation for the item. Rule Manager defines rules that determine the way that model items interact during manipulation.

As you place piping components, the software automatically creates a relationship between the pipe route and the component to create a pipe run. When you move the pipe run, the pipe route and the associated piping components both move. Your plant administrator can modify the relationships between piping components and piping in Rule Manager.

The software includes a standard group of piping component symbols. However, your plant administrator can change and add to these symbols in **Catalog Manager** as needed.

**Place a Piping Component**

1. In the **Catalog Explorer** list view, select the piping component that you want to place.
2. Drag the item to the appropriate pipe run in the drawing.
3. Position the item and release.
4. In the **Properties** window, enter values for the properties of the piping component in the appropriate rows in the table.

As you drag piping components over a pipe run, or the pointer passes over runs while you are in placement mode, the pipe run is highlighted. If you place a piping component when a pipe segment is not highlighted, the piping component is placed in free space if the placement rules allow the action.

If the item that you place has multiple possible orientations in relation to other items, you can use the Configuration (QuickPick) tool to select the appropriate placement for the item.

If you want to be able to place two inline components an arbitrary distance apart, regardless of minimum distance settings in Options Manager, do the following.

1. Place the first component in the line.
2. Place the second component into the line and connected to the connect point of the first component on the end that you want to attach to. You can see that the connect points are actually joined by the black rectangle in the Drawing view:
3. While holding down the ALT key, drag one component along the line away from the other leaving the desired distance between the two.
4. If the components are already close to each other but not connected at coincident connect points, you must drag one off of the segment to disconnect it and then move it back to get the connect points attached.
5. If you want to move a piping component but preserve its connection to the pipe run, you can use the ALT key as you drag the component. Then even if you drag the component away from the line, the line routes itself so as to preserve its connection to the component.

**Using the Piping Specification Utility**

The Piping Specification Utility (PipeSpec) works with PDS 3D, Smart 3D, or Smart Reference Data to validate the piping materials class with the temperatures, pressures, and diameters assigned to the pipe run and to search commodity codes (in all product databases) and fabrication categories (in PDS 3D databases only) for inline piping components. The database tables and library files in the products provide source information for the validation and search. The service limits validation and automatic commodity code lookup can be disabled simultaneously using a switch in Options Manager. See Configure Piping Specification Settings in the Options Manager Help..

For more information about using the Piping Specification Utility with Smart 3D, refer to the Smart P&ID Installation and Upgrade Help for details about installing **Smart 3D Piping Specification Remote** **Access Client**.

In Data Dictionary Manager, the **ValidateNomDiam.ForeignCalc** program ID, which is assigned to the **Nominal Diameter** property, starts the Piping Specification Utility and triggers the commodity code and fabrication category look-ups when a nominal diameter is changed. See Enter Required ProgIDs.

To use the Piping Specification Utility with Smart 3D, you must install the Smart 3D Piping Specification Remote Access Client, which is available on the Smart P&ID product media under **Prerequisite Software**.

To use the Piping Specification Utility with Smart Reference Data, you must first enable .NET

Framework 3.5 under Windows Features.

**PDS 3D Files Used for PipeSpec**

**pd schema** — pdtable_102 table

**ra schema** — pdtable_201 and pdtable_202 tables

**library files** — us_pjstb.l, us_pjstb.l.r, and us_pjstb.l.t (The library file locations are listed in pdtable_102.)

**.dll files** — PipeSpec.dll, pdpjs.dll, pdpjsx.dll, and ValidateServiceLimits.dll The Piping Specification utility allows separate logon for the **ra** and **pd** schemas in the PDS 3D database.

All of the displayed text strings are maintained as Visual Basic resources in the **PipeSpec.dll** file.

These strings can be translated or modified as required using a resource file editor.

When performing piping materials class validations, commodity code lookup, or validation of nominal diameter for Smart 3D or Smart Reference Data, the Piping Specification Utility assigns the highest https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

revision number from the Smart 3D or Smart Reference Data piping materials class to the **Pipe Spec** **Revision** property.

Error messages are placed in the PipeSpecError.log file in the folder assigned to the TEMP

environment variable. Error messages help you identify the cause of failure when the utility does not complete the tasks as expected. For example, if minimum requirements are not met for the look-up, the missing properties are listed in the log file.

The **ServiceLimits.log** file contains any errors encountered during the Service Limit Validation process, which runs as part of the Piping Specification Utility.

**Performing Service Limits Validation**

The Piping Specification Utility verifies that the temperatures and pressures assigned to a pipe run comply with the service limits associated with the selected Piping Materials Class. In continuous validation mode, which is activated by assigned settings in Options Manager, this verification occurs each time you modify either the Piping Materials Class or a temperature-pressure pair in the process case data of the pipe run.

The Service Limits validation requires at least one complete temperature-pressure pair from among design, alternate design, operating, and alternate operating cases. If any temperature-pressure pair violates the service limits of the selected Piping Materials Class, a warning displays the appropriate pair. This warning appears in the design software by appending an error string (‘SERVICE LIMITS ERROR’) to the name of the Piping Materials Class.

In Smart 3D, for a particular temperature-pressure pair, the service limits might also specify an accepted range of nominal diameters for the pipe run. In such cases, if the nominal diameter lies outside this range or if no value is specified for the nominal diameter, the warning also displays.

**Performing Commodity Code and Fabrication Category Look Up**

The Piping Specification Utility (PipeSpec) looks up the **Commodity Code** property (in all product databases) and the **Fabrication Category** property (in PDS 3D databases only) of inline piping components. In the continuous validation mode, this look-up occurs each time the **Piping Materials Class** or any of the case temperatures: **Design Max Temp**, **Design Min Temp**, **Operating Max Temp**, or **Operating Min Temp** are modified on the pipe run (for Smart Reference Data, only changes in the **Piping** **Materials Class** or **Design Max Temp** initiate the look-up). Validation also occurs each time the **Option** **Code** or **Nominal Diameter** of the component is modified. If the modification occurs on a property of a piping component, then the look-up is restricted to that particular component, but if the modification occurs on a property of a pipe run, then the look-up encompasses every piping component on that run.

The minimum requirements to cause a look-up are that the piping components must be in a pipe run and that the PMC and the nominal diameter of the pipe run must be specified. If temperatures do not comply with the service limits, then the **Commodity Code** property displays an error message.

The Piping Specification Utility uses process case temperatures of the run during the commodity code lookup only if the code for the component has a maximum temperature limit value in the Smart 3D or Smart https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

Reference Data database. For example, in PDS 3D, a value of -9999 for maximum temperature in pdtable_202 indicates a null value and the process case temperatures on that pipe run are ignored for the look-up. If a maximum temperature limit exists for a component, then the look-up ensures that none of the relevant process case temperatures assigned in Smart P&ID to the pipe run in which the piping component resides exceed this limit.

The units for the PDS 3D maximum temperature are those specified in Options Manager.

If continuous validation is turned on for the PipeSpec utility, then a pipe run with temperature-pressure limits that do not agree with its PMC generates **Error in PMC** in the commodity code for an inline component.

If any temperature values for the pipe run are unspecified, then for Smart Reference Data or PDS 3D, a value of zero Deg-K is assumed for each of the unspecified temperatures. For Smart 3D, an unspecified temperature is interpreted as ‘undefined’.

Smart 3D can validate commodity codes using the four case temperatures listed earlier against Maximum Temperature ranges or Minimum Temperatures specified on piping components in the Smart 3D database.

Smart Reference Data can validate commodity codes using the pipe run’s Design Max Temp against Maximum Temperatures specified on piping components in the Smart Reference Data database.

Other case maximum temperatures or minimum temperatures will not be used in the validation.

If the temperature falls within the allowable limits, the software will return a commodity code; otherwise, **Not in Spec** is returned.

Smart Reference Data supports a *single* maximum temperature only for each option code.

Smart Reference Data does not return a commodity code for reducers.

The **Fabrication Category** property of inline piping components is a select-listed property in Smart P&ID. A relationship between the fabrication category and the commodity name can be defined in the PDS 3D database. The **Commodity Name** is a unique name for every symbol. In PDS 3D, this unique name is the **AABBCC Code** property. In Smart P&ID, the commodity name corresponds to the **Short** **Value** entry of the **Piping Component Type** select list for the symbol defined in Data Dictionary Manager and it is this value of the commodity name that is used for the look-up. For a delivered symbol, the **Short Value** entry is equivalent to the symbol’s **AABBCC Code**, defined in Catalog Manager.

Similarly, the **Option Code** property is a select list of text values in Smart P&ID, while it is a set of code numbers or indices in Smart 3D. **Short Value** for the **Option Code** select list contains the Smart 3D indices corresponding to the appropriate **Option Code** text in Smart P&ID.

Based on the selected PMC and other assigned properties, such as **Nominal Diameter**, **Maximum** **Design Pressure**, **Maximum Design Temperature**, and so forth, the PipeSpec utility copies properties and checks limits in the entire run, including inline components.

If you subsequently assign nominal diameters to inline valves or other components, Smart P&ID

assigns commodity codes and fabrication categories to them that correspond to the PMC of the pipe run and the specifications in your databases (fabrication category is not supported for Smart 3D or Smart Reference Data). If you choose a diameter, for instance, that does not exist for the assigned PMC, the commodity code property becomes **Not In Spec**.

If you choose temperature-pressure limits for process cases that do not agree with the assigned PMC, then the error **Service Limits Error** is added to the PMC for the run.

Given the appropriate settings in Options Manager and Data Dictionary Manager, you can manually assign commodity codes to inline components, and the PipeSpec utility looks up accepted diameters

and validates the assignment. See Assign a Commodity Code to a Piping Component Using the

You can verify that a commodity code (in all 3D databases) and fabrication category (in PDS 3D

databases only) have been assigned in the **Properties** window, or you can open the error log, PipeSpecError.log, if properties have not been assigned as expected.

If continuous validation is turned on for the PipeSpec utility, then a pipe run with temperature-pressure limits that do not agree with its PMC generates **Error in PMC** in the commodity code for an inline component.

With continuous validation, not only is the commodity code defined automatically, but for PDS 3D, so is the **Fabrication Category** property for the inline components, if the relationship is defined in your PDS 3D database.

Adding or changing the option code can change the commodity code, if the relationship is defined in your PDS 3D database.

If continuous validation is not activated but other appropriate settings and program IDs are assigned, you can still select the **Calc** button for the **Commodity Code** property and choose a code. However this does not verify that the component agrees with a piping specification.

For additional information about the behavior of specific 3D databases when returning commodity codes, see Using the Piping Specification Utility.

**Placing Instrumentation**

You can place various types of instrumentation in your drawing, such as orifice plates, flow controllers, and pressure regulators. Instruments are devices used directly or indirectly to measure or control a variable, such as flow or temperature, in a plant process. Instruments can be items such as flow control elements, computing devices, or electrical switches. Two types of instruments exist: inline instruments and offline instruments. Signal lines are intelligent line strings that connect offline instruments, inline instruments, and piping.

**Inline Instruments**

Inline instruments are components that you can insert into a piping segment. Inline instruments include instrument valves, such as pressure regulator valves, flow controllers, flow indicators, and other instrument components, such as orifice plates. As you drag inline instruments over a pipe segment, the pipe segment appears selected. If you place an inline instrument when a pipe segment is not selected, the instrument is placed in free space.

**Offline Instruments**

Offline instruments are components that you do not insert into a piping segment. Typically, these instruments monitor and control inline instruments. Offline instruments include flow controllers, level gauges, and system functions such as digital control stations or computers.

**Instrument Loops**

You can create instrument loops containing any combination of inline and offline instruments. Instruments loops are a group of one or more instruments or control functions arranged so that signals can transfer from one function to the next to measure and control a process variable.

The software includes a standard group of instrument and instrument loop symbols; however, your plant administrator can change and add to these symbols as your plant requires.

**Loop Tag Dialog**

Allows you to search for and specify the loop tag for the item whose properties currently appear in the **Properties** window. This dialog opens when you select the ellipsis button next to the loop tag cell.

**Search for**

Allows you to type in descriptors to display the available loop tags, limited by parameters that you enter. The percent character, **%**, is a wildcard. For example, if you want to list only loop tags that contain the letter **F**, you can type **%F%** in the **Search for** box. If you want to display all available loop tags, simply type **%**.

If the **Properties** window is not visible, you can display it by selecting the instrument and then selecting **Edit** > **Properties** on the main menu bar.

As you drag inline instruments over a pipe run, the pipe run appears selected. If you place an inline instrument when a pipe segment is not selected, the instrument is placed in free space if rules defined in Rule Manager allow such a placement.

If the item you place has multiple possible orientations in relation to other items, you can use the Configuration (QuickPick) tool to select the appropriate placement for the item.

While placing an inline instrument on a pipe run with associated heat tracing, if the pointer is below the pipe run, then the heat tracing appears above the instrument and vice versa – regardless of the heat tracing orientation on the piping. By keeping the pointer either above or below the piping, you can decide the orientation for the heat tracing on the inline instrument at placement time.

**Place an Offline Instrument**

1. In the **Catalog Explorer** list view, select the offline instrument that you want to place.
2. Drag the item to the appropriate place in the drawing.
3. Position the item and release to place it.

You can select an item from **Catalog Explorer** and then place it by clicking the appropriate location in your drawing. Press ESC to quit placement mode. Or, you can escape placement mode by right-clicking.

1. In the **Properties** window, enter values for the properties of the instrument in the appropriate rows in the table.

If the **Properties** window is not visible, then you can display it by selecting the instrument and then selecting **Edit** > **Properties** on the main menu bar.

You can assign heat tracing to offline instruments, too. See Assign Heat Tracing to an Item.

If you place an offline instrument over an existing signal line, the software inserts the offline instrument in the signal line, just as piping components are inserted into pipe runs.

After you place offline instruments, you can connect them to piping segments or inline instruments using signal lines.

After you place items, you can mirror, rotate, or move them.

**Add Instruments to a Loop**

1. Select the **Catalog Explorer** tree view **Loops** node.
2. In the list view, right-click the instrument loop that you want to place.
3. Select **Send to Drawing Stockpile** or **Send to Stockpile** from the shortcut menu.
4. Define properties for the loop by entering values in the **Properties** window. The software automatically generates an item tag when you enter a tag suffix.
5. Select the item that you want to associate with the instrument loop.
6. Select the item tag of the loop from the **Loop Tag** select list in the **Properties** window, or you can select the **Calculation** button beside the **Loop Tag** property in the **Properties** window.
7. On the **Loop Tag** dialog, enter characters in the **Search for** box to display the available loop tags.
8. Select **Search Now**.
9. Choose the appropriate loop from the resulting list.

If you need to change or modify a loop, and the loop has instrument(s) already assigned to it, you can use the **Updating Associated Instruments with Loop Properties (Properties Window)** command to select those instruments whose properties you want to update to match the changes in the loop.

If an instrument-loop association is attempted and the resulting instrument item tag is a duplicate, the association will be canceled and the instrument tag will retain its original value. This can occur for single or multiple instrument-loop associations.

If an association is made between a loop and a select set consisting of several instruments and the generated item tag for some of the instruments will be duplicates, no associations will be made for the https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

duplicate instruments. A message will be displayed for each duplicate instrument indicating that the instrument tag will retain its original value.

You can assign the **Loop Tag** qualifier to instruments that are already placed in your drawing or that reside in the stockpile, and you can place instruments and then create the loop or first create the loop and then assign instruments to it as you place them.

Because loops are logical collections of instruments rather than physical groupings, you do not need to place the loop symbol in the drawing itself to create an occurrence. Instead, placing the loop in the stockpile adds the loop to the model.

You can assign a group of instruments and other elements to a loop by creating a select set of them and assigning the correct loop tag for the set.

Instrument loops normally reside in a stockpile with their members residing on drawings. Moving the instrument loop itself to another stockpile has special limitations. See Move a Stockpile Item to the

Stockpile of Another Drawing.

After you create instrument loops, you can create a customized loop report to generate lists of items in specific loops in your drawing or plant, or you can open the **Engineering Data Editor** to display elements of the loop.

If you need to refresh the instrument **Loop Tag Suffix** display in the **Properties** window, clear selection of the instrument and then select it again.

If the **Properties** window is not visible, you can display it by selecting the instrument or loop and then selecting **Edit > Properties** on the main menu bar.

**Update Associated Instruments with Loop Properties Dialog**

This dialog allows you to update the Item tag property of an instrument so that it will correspond with the current Loop tag property for that instrument. You can access this dialog by selecting the ellipsis beside **Loop Function**, **Tag Seq No**, or **Tag Suffix**.

The dialog displays the list of instruments associated with that loop. The check boxes beside the tags can be selected to determine which instruments will have their **Instrument Tag** property updated.

**Remove an Instrument from a Loop**

1. In the drawing, select the item or items that you want to remove from the loop.
2. In the **Properties** window, remove the value for the **Loop Tag** property for the selection.

When an instrument is assigned to a loop, validation automatically creates an instrument item tag. If you remove the loop tag property, the instrument item tag remains the same until the instrument is https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

You can remove an instrument from a loop by deleting the item from the model too.

If the **Properties** window is not visible, you can display it by selecting the item and then selecting **Edit**

**Using Implied Items**

An implied item is an item in the database with no graphical representation in the drawing file. You can establish implied items by the existence of a single item, or by the existence of a relationship between two items.

A common example of a symbol with implied items is a vent drain (macro component) detail. In the drawing, the vent drain detail is represented graphically by only one symbol. However, when the symbol is placed, it represents a 1-inch secondary pipe, a 3/4-inch root valve, and a plug in the database.

Selecting **Edit** > **Properties** and selecting the **Implied Items** tab on the **Rule Properties** dialog allows you to define the method for specifying implied items. The list shows all implied items for a rule. You can add or delete items by using the **Add** or **Delete** buttons beside the list.

If you associate implied items with a single item on the **Items** tab (**Item 2** is freestanding), then the software creates implied items for each instance of that item in the design. If you associate implied items with a pair of items, then the software creates implied items for each instance of the relationship between those two items.

When you delete an item, the software deletes all of the implied items that the item owns.

Because implied items are not graphical, you cannot see them in a drawing. However, you can display the items in the table view and in reports generated from the database.

For a detailed explanation of how to create a rule for an implied item, see the Smart P&ID Rule Manager documentation.

**Item Tag Validation**

The **Item Tag Validation** functionality is saved as *ItemTag.dll* and performs calculations and validations in the current plant for unique tag checking, automatic tag generation, and tag reformatting. **ItemTag** **Validation** can generate unique **Item Tag** values and maintains consistency between the **Item Tag** value and the properties used in its calculation. Validation, in addition to checking for existing item tags, also checks for duplicate item tags according to the scope specified by the particular version of the *ItemTag.dll* file.

Also, for properties included in the item tag, any leading or trailing spaces are removed during validation.

**ItemTag Validation** applies to the following item types: instrument loops, instruments, pipe runs, duct runs, equipment components, signal runs of plant item type Pipe Run (hydraulic, connect to process, and so https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

All other item types are disregarded.

**Default Item Tag Configurations**

The tables below show the item types that are validated or calculated by the **ItemTag Validation** and the column names where modifications trigger calculation and validation. Calculation or validation for an item is triggered when any property that comprises the **Item Tag** value is added or modified in the drawing.

To refresh the instrument loop tag suffix in the **Properties** window, clear the selection of the instrument and then select it again.

All calculated **Item Tag** properties listed in the tables are read-only.

The Configure Item Tag Utility allows you to customize the above item tag formats without need to make code changes and recompile the *ItemTag.dll* file. For details, see Configuring Item Tag Formats.

**Labeling**

Your main tool to add or edit text content that appears in a label is the **Properties** window. By adding or editing text, you are entering data into the database. Whenever you select a label, the corresponding labeled properties for its item appear in the **Properties** window. The same properties appear in the long list of properties when you select the item itself. Because only the label properties appear when the label is selected, you have an easier method to find to the label properties.

A label always reflects the current property values of the item that it labels. Labels that populate a property at placement are called driving labels. In other words, the predefined property value in the label overwrites the current property value on the item that it labels. Labels that do not overwrite the property at placement are called driven labels. Labels are defined as *driven* or *driving* in **Catalog Manager**.

If you enter text with a recognized unit of measure using a quotes or double-quotes, the software parses the unit of measure and ignores the double-quotes (or tick marks).

If you place a label on a pipe run and a red X displays, this indicates an inconsistency with the item being labeled. For example, if you place a pipe run and then place **Stress Analysis - Complete** label, a red X appears. This indicates that the label is inconsistent with the pipe run value.

At label creation time, the plant administrator can define text content inside the label with the SmartText editor in **Catalog Manager**. When placing a label later, you cannot edit text such as **OLL=** on the OLL

Elevation Equipment label. Nonetheless, you can place free text in an item note.

Different labels have different label properties. The following table identifies some of the label properties that are defined during label creation in **Catalog Manager**. After the creation of a label, these properties dictate label placement behavior. You do not see label properties while using the design software; these properties perform their function in the background and are invisible to you.

When placing labels that follow the orientation of components, there are certain recommendations for assigning properties during label creation. For details, see the ‘Component’ section in Using Label

Types.

**Table notes**

The four types of labels (title block, flow arrow, component, and break) appear in columns. Label properties appear in rows.

‘Yes’ indicates that the property applies to that type of label.

‘Not applicable’ indicates that the property does not apply to that type of label.

Special notes, such as ‘1- Point’ for single-point placement, indicate that the property applies under certain conditions.

**Placing Labels**

You can place a label in a few basic steps. First, you select the label that you want from **Catalog Explorer** and then identify the item in the drawing that you want to label.

Labels can have two-point placement or one-point placement. You use one-point placement when a single point in the drawing identifies both the item to label and the location of the label. You use two-point placement when you need one click to identify the item to label and a second click to indicate a different location for the label.

Some labels have no symbology associated with them; that is, they contain text only (for example, the **Short Description** label for Equipment). If you place such a label, but the properties that normally appear have not been entered yet, you have an empty label. Because there is no symbology associated with this type of label, it would be essentially invisible on the drawing. However, empty labels display a question mark so that you can find them more easily and not unnecessarily repeat work.

You can add a leader line to a label by right-clicking on the label and choosing **Leader line display**. If you place a leader line with the label, the first click also identifies the end of the leader.

Labels can be moved by selecting the label and dragging the black square at the center of the label. Drag the label to the location that you want it to occupy in the drawing.

You set the placement type of a label at its creation in Catalog Manager. Afterwards, you cannot change the placement type in the design software.

Changing default label formats in Options Manager (for example, changing temperature from K to °C) does not change labels that are already placed in drawings. After you have changed the label format using Options Manager, you can use the **Update Drawings** command in Drawing Manager or use the **Replace** command in Smart P&ID to update the existing labels in your drawings.

182/984

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

When placed on a drawing, all delivered labels that include units of measure use the plant default formats defined in Options Manager, and so labels do not always display the units of measure selected in the **Properties** window. To ensure that a label displays the units of measure specified in the **Properties** window, in **Catalog Manager**, select the required label, and from the **Format** list on the **SmartText Editor** dialog, select the **As Entered** option.

A line label follows a line when you change its angle, for example, changing from horizontal to vertical.

A label and its assigned leader line follow when you move a line. When you recalculate a line, the software does not delete the label but repositions it in an associated location on the line.

When you place a property break label, the software stops the sharing of data between segments of pipe. In other words, you break the pipe run.

When you place an off-page connector (OPC), the software automatically creates and stores a matching connector in either a plant or project stockpile or the stockpile of another drawing. The matching connector receives the value, for example, **From Drawing 123**, where the number corresponds to the drawing. After you place the matching connector from the stockpile into the related drawing, the software automatically updates the matching connector in the original drawing (**To** **Drawing 122**, for example).

**Place a Label from Catalog Explorer**

1. Select the label that you want from the **Catalog Explorer** list view.
2. Click the item in the drawing that you want to label.
3. If the properties of the label require two-point placement, click again to place the label where you want it in relation to other items in the drawing.

Labels are a special class of item in **Catalog Explorer**. Depending on the definition of the label, you place labels with one-point or two-point placement. If the label is designed for two-point placement, you must use item placement mode instead of the drag method. An example of one-point placement is placing an ID label on a valve. An example of two- point placement is placing an equipment label on a pump.

You can edit the database properties for the labeled item after you have placed the label.

**One-Point Label Placement**

To illustrate placing a label with this placement method, consider placement of a Tag ID label on a valve.

You point to the valve, and it is highlighted indicating that you can place a label. When you click the valve, the software places the component label.

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

This valve received a label with one-point placement. Properties include an **Offset Distance** value of .5

inch, no leader line, a **Cursor Location** value of above midpoint, and an **Offset Source** value of local.

These properties are set in Catalog Manager during label creation.

The dots on the valve and label are not part of these drawing items. The dots represent the center of the bounding box. These midpoints always align when you place a label with one-point placement. Midpoints align at the y-axis of the local coordinate system of the symbol with the label. This y-axis alignment line crosses the center of the labeled item. Offset is always a positive value.

Pointer position determines if you place the label above or below the component. If the pointer appears above the center (that is, the y coordinate is a positive value) you are placing the label above the item. If the pointer appears below the center (that is, the y coordinate is a negative value) you are placing the label below the item. The center of the bounding box is (0,0), the local origin.

For a pipe run, the center is the point where the pointer touches the line. The tolerance for the **Select** command determines the distance above and below the pipe run. The alignment axis is perpendicular to the line at this point.

When you point to locations in the drawing and locate a valid target, the label immediately moves to this position. The label remains in dynamics (you can move the label to a different location before you place it) so you can confirm correct placement.

The property for offset source also affects label placement. If the value for offset source is **None**, the software uses the default offset distance, designated in Options Manager. In this example, the software aligns the center of the label at the center of the item receiving the label. This action allows you to place labels on a line and at the center of symbols. A value of **Zero** offset distance aligns the bounding boxes.

Label Offset options can be universally applied by inputting a value in the **Distances** option in Options Manager; however, if a label offset is designated for the label during creation in Catalog Manager, that value overrides the Options Manager setting.

**Place a One-Point Label**

1. In the **Catalog Explorer** list view, select the label that you want to place.
2. Drag the label to the appropriate place in the drawing.
3. Release the label when the target is highlighted.

When you drag a label over an appropriate target, the target is highlighted.

The pointer position, in relation to the item when you place the label, determines if you place the label above or below the item in the drawing.

1. In the **Properties** window, select or type values for the properties of the label in the appropriate rows in the table, if needed.

Title blocks, flow arrows, off-page connectors, and some component labels use one-point placement.

A label display always reflects the values of the item with which it is associated. Labels that populate the item values at placement time are called driving labels. In other words, the predefined properties in the label overwrite current item properties when the label is placed. Labels that do not overwrite the item properties are called driven labels. Labels are defined as driven or driving in Catalog Manager.

If you place a flow arrow label on a process run, the direction of the arrow changes depending on the flow direction of the process run. If the process run has no direction defined for it, the direction of the flow arrow label defines the flow direction of the process run. You can use the Configuration Tool, or QuickPick, to select the direction of a flow arrow as you place it.

If you place an off-page connector on a pipe in the drawing, the software fills in the connector number and automatically adds a second off-page connector to either the Stockpile or the stockpile of another drawing. When you place the second connector in a drawing, the software automatically updates the number and name of the drawings in both off-page connectors.

To display a leader line for the label, right-click the label, and then select **Leader line display** on the shortcut menu.

If the **Properties** window is not visible, you can display it by selecting a label and then selecting **Edit** > **Properties** on the main menu bar.

**Two-Point Label Placement**

To illustrate placing a label with this placement method consider placement of an **Equipment ID** label on a pump. When you point to the pump, it is highlighted, indicating that you can place the label. When you click the pump, the software recognizes the pump as a target for the label. That action is the first point of two-point placement. At the location on the drawing that you want actually to place the label, click again. That action is the second point of two-point placement. After the first click, the pointer changes from a northwest arrow, , to a four-headed arrow,

, until you place the label with your second click. During the time between the first and second clicks, the label is attached to the pointer.

This pump received a label by using two-point placement. (1) and (2) illustrate the two pointer positions and clicks required to place this label. Properties include a **Rotation** value of false and a **Leader line** value of true. These properties are set through Catalog Manager during label creation.

With two-point placement, the software does not use properties for offset distance or pointer location. You can place the first point anywhere on the item to receive the label. The leader line points to this location.

**Place a Two-Point Label**

1. In the **Catalog Explorer** list view, select the label that you want to place.
2. In the drawing, select the item that you want to label. As the pointer passes over an appropriate target item for the label, the software highlights the item. To label the item, click the item when the software highlights it.
3. Select the location in the drawing for the label.
4. Press ESC to quit label placement mode.

As an alternative, you can escape placement mode by right-clicking.

1. In the **Properties** window, specify the properties of the label in the appropriate rows. If the **Properties** window is not displayed, you can display it by selecting the label and then selecting **Edit** > **Properties**.

After you place a label, you can move it and manipulate its leader line. See Modifying and Moving

Placed Items and Manipulate a Leader Line

Property break labels and various types of component labels require two-point placement.

**Copy Labels**

1. In the Drawing view, select the label that you want to copy.
2. Right-click the label and select **Place New** from the shortcut menu or select **Place New** on the

**Run Macro** toolbar. The **Place New** icon does not appear on the **Run Macro** toolbar until you select a label.

1. Double-click **UpdateLabelsCmd.dll**. You can find this macro in the ..\SmartPlant\P&ID

Workstation\bin folder.

The **UpdateLabelsCmd.dll** refreshes the value of the currently placed label properties as displayed on the drawing. The command does not update the label based on modifications made to the label using **Catalog Manager**. To update the label if changes have been made using **Catalog Manager**, the label must be replaced in the drawing using **Edit** > **Replace**.

**Batch Labeling**

In Smart P&ID, you can perform batch placement of labels on selected drawing items using the Auto Labeling feature.

**Perform batch labeling of drawing items**

1. Fence select a group of items in the drawing sheet.
2. Select **Tools** > **Auto Labeling**.
3. In the **Select Catalog Item** dialog, expand the nodes in the tree view pane to select a node containing labels appropriate for one of the item types among the selected drawing items. For example, if the items you selected include pumps, you can place labels delivered with the software from any of the following catalog item folders:

**Design**

**Design** > **Annotation** > **Labels**

**Equipment** > **Labels - Equipment**

**Equipment** > **Mechanical** > **Labels - Mechanical** **Equipment** > **Mechanical** > **Labels - Mechanical** > **Drivers** For a full list of item types and available corresponding label types, see Select Catalog Item Dialog.

1. In the list view pane, select the label you want to place.
2. Select **OK** to place the labels of the selected type automatically.

Labels are added for the appropriate items and a message displays showing the total number of labels placed on the drawing items.

You can select only *one* label when assigning labels to the selected drawing items. The software does not allow you to make a multiple selection and therefore you have to repeat this procedure for every different label you want to assign.

**Using Label Types**

The type of label that you place determines the workflow that you follow. You define the label type when you create a label in Catalog Manager. As defined in Rule Manager, rules apply when you are placing a label.

The following four types of labels are Title Block, Flow Arrow, Component, and Break.

**Title Block**

The title block label is unique among label types because you do not have to identify the item to receive the label. The title block usually displays general information about a drawing. After you select the label in the list view, you can drag it to the location in the drawing where you want to assign the label.

After the title block is placed in a drawing you can modify label properties using the **Property** window (for example, **Title** and **Description**). Any properties that you cannot modify while in Smart P&ID would need to https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

be modified using Drawing Manager (for example, **Drawing Number** and **Drawing Name**). The different template files, which create new drawing files, contain different title blocks. Therefore, you can automatically place standard title blocks in standard drawings, which are built on standard templates. Or, you can create custom title block labels to fit your custom templates.

**Flow Arrow**

You place flow arrows in process runs. When you place the label, the arrow orients itself with the flow in the process run if you have already defined flow direction. If you have not specified a flow direction, then the direction you place the flow arrow defines it for you (that is, a flow arrow is a driving label).

As you drag the label from the list view of **Catalog Explorer**, process runs in the Drawing view are highlighted when you pause over them. Click a highlighted process run to place the label. Flow arrows require only one click to place them.

After placing the label, you can change the flow direction of the process run in the **Properties** window, and the flow arrow reorients itself accordingly. You cannot change *label* properties that appear in the **Properties** window for a flow arrow.

**Component**

This type of label identifies physical commodities in the model. A typical example is an Equipment ID label.

Properties assigned to the label affect its behavior.

Component labels have a unique property: **Label Behavior**. The values are defined in a select list in Data Dictionary Manager and are chosen in Catalog Manager when you create a label. The default value is **Follow**. Values for this property can include the following:

**Follow (no rotate)**

The label does move but does not rotate, corresponding to changes to the labeled item.

**Follow**

The label does move and rotate, corresponding to changes to the labeled item.

**Fixed**

The label does not move if you move the labeled item.

This illustration shows component labels that you use to label vessels, nozzles, and piping components. It also depicts both fixed and rotated orientations of labels.

For labels that are to be placed on components, we recommend that you comply with the following guidelines during label creation to avoid undesirable results that may occur when drawings are recreated:

Create separate component labels for placement on horizontal and vertical objects.

If you want to pre-rotate a text box for a label, rotate it -90 degrees rather than +90 degrees, so that when the label is placed on vertical objects, it will be left-aligned and will grow towards the right if a value is assigned after placement.

Do not combine mirror and rotate operations on a symbol for a label. This means that if a label needs to be rotated, then do not further mirror it; if a label needs to be mirrored, do not further rotate it.

If you *do* need to mirror and rotate a symbol, make sure that the text box is center aligned and justified.

**Break**

A break label, or property break label, graphically shows that a change occurs or can occur in a property at some point in the process. This label indicates to the software that an inconsistency for that property is acceptable. As a result, the software does not issue a warning, or an existing inconsistency resolves itself when you place the break.

A break label can only be placed at a connection point where the specified properties are being propagated.

Break labels do not set properties but note that a value change is acceptable for the property at the indicated point. Text included in the label reflects the property at that point. You can associate multiple property breaks with one point on the drawing.

You place property break labels, in the **Segment Breaks** node of **Catalog Explorer**, with two-point placement.

You can turn on or off the **Is Leader Visible** property in Catalog Manager. After you place the label, you can right-click the label, and then select **Leader line display** on the shortcut menu to control the display of the leader line in the drawing software.

Use care when you assign leader lines. You can place several break labels at one point, and multiple leader lines can be confusing.

**Place a Title Block**

1. Find the title block that corresponds to your drawing template in the** Catalog Explorer** **List** view.
2. Select the label and position it over the pre-defined title area on the drawing so that the elements of the label fall within the cells of the title area.
3. Click to place the title block.
4. Press ESC to quit placement mode.

You can review the properties of the title block label in the **Properties** window. You can modify some of these properties using the **Properties** window, for example, **Description**, **Title**, and **Title Block** **Revision**. If you want to modify the **Name** and **Drawing Number** properties, you must exit the drawing and make the edits using Drawing Manager. See Drawing Manager Help.

You can move the title block if you need to position it more carefully within the title area of the drawing.

See Move an Item with the Select Tool.

**Place a Flow Arrow**

1. Find the flow arrow in the list view of **Catalog Explorer** and select it.
2. Position your pointer over the process run that you want to label.
3. If a flow direction has not been specified, then choose an orientation for the arrow so that it reflects the correct direction.

If a flow direction has already been specified for the line, then the flow arrow orients itself so that it reflects that property.

If you pause over a line whose flow direction has not been defined, you can use QuickPick to position the flow arrow.

1. Click to place the flow arrow on the process run.
2. Continue placing flow arrows, or press ESC to quit placement mode.

You must change the flow direction of a line by changing the property in the **Properties** window. Do not rotate a flow arrow by using the **Rotate** command or the rotate handle in order to change the flow direction; flow direction is a property.

**Place a Component Label**

1. From the list view in **Catalog Explorer**, choose the label that you want to place.
2. Place the pointer over the component that you want to label.
3. Place the label using either one- point or two-point placement methods, depending on the label. See

Place a One-Point Label and Place a Two-Point Label.

1. Continue placing the same label or press ESC to quit placement mode.

**Place a Break Label**

1. From the **List** view in **Catalog Explorer**, select the break label that you want to place.

The **Catalog Explorer** **Tree** view node where break labels are located is called **Segment** **Breaks**.

1. Place the break label using two-point placement. The first click (1) specifies the junction in the process line, the second click (2) designates the location for the break label itself.
2. Continue placing the same break label at other junctions in the drawing, or press ESC to quit placement mode.

A break label can only be placed at a connection point where the specified properties are being propagated.

To place a break label on a valve located in the middle of a pipe run, you must first break the pipe run manually.

You can turn on or off the **Is Leader Visible** property in Catalog Manager. After you place the label, you can right-click the label, and then select **Leader line display** on the shortcut menu to control the display of the leader line in the drawing software.

Use care when you assign leader lines. You can place several break labels at one point, and multiple leader lines can be confusing.

**Label Properties**

The following label properties are available for specifying your labels:

Labeled Item Type

Offset Distance

Offset Source

Is Mirrorable

Is Rotatable

Is Fit To Text

Is Leader Visible

Label Terminator Styles

Disable Flip Text

Area Break Label

Label Behavior

Label Type

Leader Style

Placement Type

**Labeled Item Type**

This property defines the type of item that your label is used with. When you create a label in Catalog Manager, you must specify this property; you cannot change it in the design software. The property must be defined correctly to allow you to place labels. When you create a label in Catalog Manager, you choose the labeled item type from the **Item** list in the SmartText Editor. That list is defined in Data Dictionary Manager, where all the valid item types are defined and stored.

Examples of labeled item types include pipe run, instrument, piping component, equipment, and so forth. If you specify that the labeled item type is a pipe run, then you can place your label on a pipe run and not on any other type of item in your drawing.

**Offset Distance**

This property defines the distance from the labeled item to the label. Offset distance applies for labels that are defined with one-point placement. This property also applies for two- point label placement if the property for offset source is set to **Local**. The property must be defined correctly in Catalog Manager to allow you to place your label. The actual plant- wide offset distance is specified in Options Manager.

The software measures the distance from the bounding box of the item to receive the label and the bounding box of the label itself. Consider the offset as the clearance distance between the bounding boxes.

The bounding box in Smart P&ID differs from the SmartSketch definition of range. SmartSketch (A) uses the x-y coordinate range around an item. Smart P&ID (B) uses a rectangular area.

For a line segment, the bounding box is the line itself.

**Offset Source**

This property specifies the origin for the offset distance. The possible values for offset sources are listed below.

**None**

The label does not have an offset. This value indicates placement at the center of the labeled item.

**Project Settings**

Plant-level parameters determine the offset distance. You can use Options Manager to define the plant settings distance.

**Local**

The label does have an offset, and the value for the **Offset Distance** property, which is specified in Catalog Manager, defines the offset to use.

You set this property when you create a label in Catalog Manager. Afterwards, you cannot change the offset source property in the drawing software. Likewise, you set the local offset distance when you create a label, and you cannot change the property in the drawing software.

**Is Mirrorable**

The value of this property is set to **True** to indicate that you can mirror the item. The value of this property is set to **False** to indicate that you cannot create a reverse image. You define this property when you create a label in Catalog Manager.

**Disable Flip Text**

This value allows you to rotate or orient text for readability. By default, the software displays text in a readable manner and will not allow it to display upside down. For example, if you move a label in a direction that would affect the readability of the text, the software automatically flips the text so that it can still be read. Using **Catalog Manager**, you can disable this option and allow the text to display upside down if needed.

If setting this property from the **Properties** window in Smart P&ID, value of the **Rotation angle** of the selected symbol should be ‘0’ degrees.

**Is Rotatable**

The value of this property is set to **True** to indicate that you can rotate the item. The value of this property is set to **False** to indicate that you cannot change the angular orientation. You set this property when you create a label in Catalog Manager.

**Is Fit To Text**

The value of this property is set to **True** if the label graphics must fit around the text when you place the label. The value of this property is set to **False** if the label graphics do not need to fit around text. You can change the designation in Catalog Manager.

You can set the value to **True** only for enclosures that are circles, ellipses, rectangles, or parametrics. You set the **Is Fit To Text** property when you create a label in Catalog Manager.

The following illustration is an example of a label with the **Is Fit To Text** property set to **False**. The rectangle appears at the same size when you created it:

This illustration is an example of a label with the **Is Fit To Text** property set to **True**. The rectangle resizes to fit around the text:

**Is Leader Visible**

The value of this property is set to **True** to indicate that the label includes a leader line. The value of this property is set to **False** to indicate that the label does not include a leader line. You set this property when you create a label in Catalog Manager. You can turn on or off the display of the leader line after you place the label.

To turn on or turn off the display of the leader line, right-click the label, and select **Leader line** **display**.

**Label Terminator Styles**

The **Terminator Style** property specifies the terminator, if any, to place at the end of a leader line. Choices include **None**, ** Arrow**,** Solid Dot**, and so forth. This property applies only to labels whose value of the** Leader Line** property is set to **True**. You specify these properties when you create a label in Catalog Manager. Afterwards, you cannot change the terminator type property in the design software.

**Area Break Label**

The Area Break Label is a classification of attributes associated to a shape by virtue of the labels associated with it. The area break attributes are dynamically created by placing labels on an area break.

**Label Behavior**

The **Label Behavior** property sets or returns an enumerated value specifying the modify behavior of the label. The possible values are **Fixed**, **Follow**, and **Follow (no rotate)**.

**Fixed**

The the label does not move.

**Follow**

The label is transformed exactly the same as the labeled item.

**Follow (no rotate)**

The label is moved but not rotated.

**Label Type**

The **Label Type** property sets or returns an enumerated value specifying the label type.

**Leader Style**

The **Leader Style** property sets or returns a string value defining the style of the leader line. The style can include color, weight, and pattern.

**Placement Type**

The **Placement Type** property sets or returns an enumerated value specifying the placement mode for the label. You must select either **One Point** or **Two Point** placement. **One Point** placement automatically positions the label at an offset from the given point. **Two Point** placement allows you to reposition the label after identifying the item to be labeled with the first click.

**Using Off-Page and Utility Connectors**

A connector is not actually a label but more like a component that includes a label. Placement behavior for a connector is very similar to a standard piping component label. OPCs, utility connectors, and piping components are inserted into a line.

The drawing needs a connector when a process line or signal line continues on another drawing. The minimum information in the label portion is the drawing name to which the connector points and the connector number. Connectors do not have a property for flow direction, although most connectors use an arrowhead to indicate direction. When a connector is placed, it does not set or respond to flow direction.

The connector represents continuation, not connectivity or flow.

During document creation, when the first connector of the pair is placed, the software places the partner in either the Plant Stockpile or the stockpile of another drawing of your choice. The default placement for the partner is in the Plant Stockpile. When you create a connector and place it in a drawing, the property for the drawing name is not defined. The partner in the stockpile reflects the drawing name in which its match was located. When you place the partner from the stockpile, the first connector is updated to reflect the drawing name where you placed the partner connector. As a result, you never need to type a drawing name and the software guarantees a valid match.

OPC pairs have a *to* and *from* orientation. The software does not use the graphical *to* and *from* distinctions, but reading the drawing is easier for you with this differentiation.

1. The OPC is a *to* connector if its connected point appears at the *finish* end of the connector.
2. The OPC is a *from* connector if its connected point appears at the *start* end of the connector.

In order to switch between *to* and *from* orientations, you must disconnect the OPC from the line and then rotate or mirror it. Then you can reconnect the line to the other end of the OPC. At the time of placement, https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

you can pause when placing the OPC and wait for the QuickPick tool in order to choose the correct orientation.

You can delete a connector from the drawing, and the software moves it to a stockpile and updates the properties of its partner. To delete a connector from a stockpile, both must reside there, and you delete both from a stockpile. After you delete a connector, you cannot reuse the same number. You can change the connector number but not the drawing name in these labels. However, you can change other properties. If you copy a connector, the software must generate new connector numbers and add a partner to a stockpile.

The property for drawing name changes to **Null** or **Undefined** for the copy.

These properties exist for connectors:

Offset source is set to **None**.

Rotation is set to **True**.

Leader line is set to **False**.

In **Catalog Explorer**, Off-Drawing or Off-Unit OPCs are available for instruments. Two types of connectors are available for process lines: Off-Drawing or Off-Unit OPCs or Utility Connectors. The correct symbology differentiates OPCs. You define symbology in Options Manager.

**Understanding System Editing and OPCs**

An OPC can be placed as a freestanding item in a drawing or it can be placed onto an existing process line or signal line (line). If an OPC has been placed as a freestanding item, a line can be attached to it. When the relationship between the OPC and the line is created (either by placing the OPC or by placing the line), the system finds the applicable rules, copies the specified properties and evaluates the consistency criteria.

When the first OPC (of an OPC pair) is connected to a line, there is no line connected to the mate OPC.

Because there is no other line, the system will not find any applicable rules.

When the second OPC (of an OPC pair) is connected to a line, however, the system will find the rules that apply to this pair of lines. The system copies the specified properties from the line in the other drawing to the line in the active drawing. This copy operation will not overwrite any existing values. (The **Copy** is forced into the **Copy If Null** mode.) The properties that are copied across the OPC are propagated into the active drawing. This can mean that property values on items other than the connected line are affected. However, this is only done if the current value is **Null**. Existing values are not overwritten. After the copy process is complete, the consistency criteria are evaluated and inconsistencies are generated for all inconsistent properties.

Each time a drawing is opened, a routine is executed to update all of the OPCs in that drawing. Also, the relationship between the OPC and the connected line is updated. During this update, the rule base is searched to find all of the applicable rules. If the mate OPC has been connected to a new line since the last time this drawing was opened, it might find a different set of rules that apply. After finding the applicable rules, the consistency criteria are evaluated and inconsistencies are generated for all inconsistent https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

properties. Property values are not automatically copied across OPCs during this processing. If you want to copy changed property values across OPCs, you can use the **Solutions** that are available in the **Consistency Check** dialog.

The text in the label on the OPC is also updated. If the mate OPC has been placed into a different drawing since the last time this drawing was opened, this change will be reflected in the updated label.

**System Editing and Changing Property Values Across OPCs**

When a property value is changed on a process line or signal line (line) that is connected to an OPC, it is expected that the connected line in the continuation drawing should be changed in a corresponding manner.

You can achieve this result with a workflow that *pulls* the change into the other drawing.

This workflow allows you to *pull* a changed property value across an OPC into the continuation drawing.

When a property value is changed on a line that is connected to an OPC, an inconsistency is generated at the OPC. This inconsistency indicates that the two connected lines have different values. To resolve this inconsistency, you must close the active drawing and open the continuation drawing. In that drawing, another inconsistency is shown at the mate OPC. You can double-click on that inconsistency to display the **Consistency Check** dialog. A solution is displayed to **Copy** the new value from the first drawing onto the line in the active drawing. If you apply this solution, the value is copied into the active drawing and propagated to the related items. This resolves the inconsistency in the second drawing. The next time the first drawing is opened, the inconsistency will be resolved there as well.

If you use Plant Editing to change a property value in a non-active drawing, propagation occurs according to the System Editing rules defined for the plant and the **Engineering Data Editor** display is automatically updated. This includes propagation of data between non-active drawings across Off-Page Connectors (OPCs) when both drawings involved are not opened by a user. Propagation does *not* occur across OPCs between the active drawing and a non-active drawing.

**Place an OPC or Utility Connector**

1. From the list view in **Catalog Explorer** or from a stockpile, select the connector that you want to place. In **Catalog Explorer**, Off-Drawing and Off-Unit OPCs are available for instruments or duct runs.

Off-Drawing OPCs, Off-Unit OPCs, and Utility Connectors are available for pipe runs. The correct symbology (for example, line weight and color) differentiates OPCs. You define symbology with Options Manager.

1. Click the location in the drawing where you want to place the connector.

You can place a connector in free space on the drawing and route a line to it, or you can place it at the end of a line that already is drawn.

If you are placing a connector in free space, rotate or mirror the OPC after placement in order to get the correct orientation. Then route the line to it.

If you are placing a connector at the end of an existing line, you can wait for the QuickPick tool so that you can choose the correct orientation.

1. Modify the properties of the connector in the **Properties** window. If you placed a new connector from **Catalog Explorer**, you can display and select the partner in the **Engineering Data Editor** and modify its properties, too.

Utility connectors support only one-to-one relationships. In other words, they come in pairs only.

When you place a utility connector and its partner goes to a stockpile, that partner connector is of the same type as the first connector you placed. In order to change the partner connector to the other type of utility connector, you must place the partner in its drawing and then replace the symbol. See

Replace an Item Using Replace Mode.

When a drawing (Drawing A) becomes out-of-date for modifying its properties, then all the partner OPCs of Drawing A will also be shown as out-of-date with respect to Out-of-date model items.

Therefore, update Drawing A first, to update the partner OPCs. See Updating Drawings.

**To / From Dialog (Properties Window)**

Opens when you select **To / From** in the **Properties** window when an OPC or other connector is selected, and allows you to enter a text value to be displayed in the connector. Select the ellipses to open this dialog.

**Description**

Allows you to enter *to* or *from* information for the connector. You can enter drawing names or numbers or other pertinent information about the connected drawing or the direction of flow.

**Change Default Storage Location for Partner Connector**

1. Select **Tools** > **Options**.
2. Select the **Placement** tab.
3. Select or clear the **Place partner OPC in Stockpile** option.

If the **Place partner OPC in Stockpile** option is not selected, the **Set Stockpile Location for** **Partner OPC** dialog displays whenever you place a connector. This dialog allows you to place each partner OPC in the stockpile of a specific drawing.

**Store a Partner Connector**

1. Place a connector in a drawing.
2. On the **Set Stockpile Location of Partner OPC** dialog, choose the stockpile in which you want the partner stored.

If you have not deactivated the default storage for connectors, this dialog does not appear because the partner connector is placed directly into the Stockpile. However, you can change the default storage location. See Change Default Storage Location for Partner Connector.

**Move a Connector to Another Stockpile**

1. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, select the connector that you want to move.
2. On the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar, select **Actions** > **Move to Different Stockpile**. If you select a connector that you do not have write privileges for, then the **Move to Different Stockpile** command is not available. That is, you cannot move a connector that belongs to a different drawing, for instance.
3. On the **Move to Different Stockpile** dialog, select the plant hierarchy element that contains the drawing whose stockpile you want to assign the connector to. If you do not want to place the connector in a stockpile of a specific drawing, you can select Stockpile at the bottom of the **Plant** **hierarchy** tree.
4. In the **Drawing list** area, select the drawing whose stockpile you want to add the partner to.

**Delete a Connector from the Model**

1. Right-click the connector that you want to remove from the model.
2. On the shortcut menu, select **Delete from Model**.

This command is available only when the partner of the selected connector is stored in the Plant Stockpile or in the Drawing Stockpile, not placed in another drawing.

When this command is invoked, the selected connector *and* its partner in the relevant stockpile are removed from the model.

If you want to move the connector to one of the stockpiles instead of deleting it completely from the database, on the **Edit** or shortcut menu, select **Delete to Stockpile** > **Plant** or **Delete to Stockpile** > **Drawing**.

1. In the Drawing view, right-click the connector whose partner you want to move.
2. From the shortcut menu, select Move Partner OPC. If you select a connector that you do not have

write privileges for, then the **Move Partner OPC** command is not available. That is, if the partner connector belongs to another drawing, you cannot move it, for instance. However, you can use Open

Continuation Drawing on the shortcut menu to open the other drawing and move the connector from

its stockpile. See Open a Continuation Drawing.

1. On the Move Partner OPC Dialog, select the plant hierarchy element that contains the drawing whose stockpile you want to assign the connector to. If you do not want to place the connector in a stockpile of a specific drawing, you can select **Stockpile** at the bottom of the **Plant hierarchy** tree.
2. In the **Drawing list** area, select the drawing whose stockpile you want to add the partner to.

If the partner connector is in a stockpile and is displayed in the **Engineering Data Editor**, you can move it from there. See Move a Connector to Another Stockpile.

**Open Continuation Drawing Command (OPC Shortcut Menu)**

Opens the connected drawing when the partner of the selected off-page or utility connector is in a drawing or a drawing stockpile. This command is not available if the partner OPC is in the stockpile (instead of a drawing or drawing stockpile). If the partner OPC is in the drawing and not in the drawing stockpile, the software highlights and zooms in on the partner OPC.

**Adding Design Elements**

**Using Annotations**

Annotations are model items used to add notes, remarks, and other information to your drawing. You can use annotations to include any type of information previously inserted into a drawing using primitive commands. Annotations include everything from geometric shapes to extension and dimension lines.

Because annotations are frequently parametric, often you can resize them to fit your needs.

Placing annotations works like placing any other component in a drawing. When you place an annotation, which has an item type of item note, on a drawing, you can then place a label on the item note. These labels allow you to enter the remarks, notes, and other information that you need to effectively annotate your drawings.

You cannot annotate drawings by opening them in SmartSketch and adding drawing items to the drawing. Opening and saving a .pid file in SmartSketch can corrupt the file, making the drawing unusable.

Annotations are a way to place free remarks in a drawing. There are several design labels of different formats available in **Catalog Explorer**. Most of these labels require placing an annotation point or other design graphic on the drawing first and then attaching a label to the graphic. The plain annotation point is located in the **Graphics** folder under the **Annotation** node; however, there is one item in the **Labels** folder with an annotation point built into it. It is called **Item Note & Label**, and it looks like this: 1. Annotation point

## 2. Item note

**Place General Information on a Drawing**

On a drawing, you can place symbols with general or title block information such as plant data, revision data, date and time stamps, and display set data. You create these symbols in Catalog Manager using the **Insert** > **Title Block Field** command. For further information, see *Catalog Manager Help*, *Defining a Title* *Block*.

Cloud Small

= CLOUDSMALL

In addition, for MicroStation, the PIDLineStylesV8.rsc file, delivered with Smart P&ID, must be copied to the MicroStation installation folder: C:\ProgramData\Bentley\WorkSpace\System\Symb.

**Modifying and Moving Placed Items**

You can modify the items placed in a drawing in several ways. Obviously, you can move items or groups of items from one location to another in the drawing. If you want to change the orientation of items, you can mirror and rotate most items. You can also move groups of items to another open drawing in the same plant hierarchy.

Depending on the rules defined for particular items in the drawing, limits exist for possible placements. For example, specific trays can be flagged for placement inside a piece of equipment, and you can only move these inside the equipment. Rule Manager defines rules that determine the way that model items interact during manipulation. The software processes rules defined for items as you move them, as well as when you place them.

You can resize or scale parametric items by using their parametric handles. Resizing parametric items maintains certain characteristics of the item, such as angles between elements of the symbol, while it allows modification of other characteristics of the item, such as the length of its sides. Many items are now scalable, too, and can be resized by using their scale handles.

You can modify the properties of an item by selecting the item and changing individual properties in the **Properties** window. Also you can edit some item properties in the **Engineering Data Editor** in the **Design** window by selecting a table cell and filling in the appropriate information. You can select an entire row by clicking on the corresponding row number to the left of the table and then viewing the properties in the **Properties** window and editing them there.

If you want to remove an item from a drawing, you can delete the item. If the plant model requires the deleted item, the item appears in the stockpile for later placement. If the plant model does not require the item, it disappears from the drawing completely. You can permanently remove required items from the plant model using the **Delete from Model** command.

When modifying or setting the fluid code properties of a line, you always select the fluid code from a select list. If you do not set the fluid code first, you will see all possible fluid codes. If you set the fluid system prior to setting the fluid code, then only the fluid codes applicable to the type of fluid system display. To redisplay a complete list of available fluid code values, delete the property for the fluid system, and then the complete list of fluid code values appears.

If the **Properties** window is not open, you can display it by selecting an item and then selecting **Edit** > **Properties**.

**Undo Command (Edit Menu)**

Rejects the last action that you completed.

Up to ten operations are saved in the undo list, and you can undo them by repeated use of the **Undo** command. The undo list is cleared if you perform any of the following actions: Change the properties of the Drawing view on the **View Properties** dialog Turn the display of inconsistency indicators off or on by selecting **View** > **Show Inconsistencies** Select **File** > ** Save**

Open a different drawing or toggle to another open drawing

Open a new Drawing view or new **Engineering Data Editor**

Perform Plant Editing

Move a connector to another drawing stockpile by using commands in the **Engineering Data Editor** or on the** Connector** shortcut menu

An action that can be undone is defined in several ways. Running a command is usually an action.

Modifying item properties is an action that ends when another item is selected. This definition of an action holds true for select sets, too, and for multiple items selected in the **Engineering Data Editor**. That is, modifying the properties of a select set is one action in and of itself, not one action for each member of the set.

If you are placing items in a Typical view, the **Undo** command will undo placement of all Typicals placed in the last operation, not just the last Typical record placed, and will return the user to the Primary view.

The **Undo** command does not reverse view manipulations. However, the **View** > **Previous** command is still available for that purpose.

**Undo Your Last Action**

Select **Undo** .

Pressing CTRL + Z also undoes your last action.

The **Undo** command stores up to 10 actions making this command available repeatedly.

If the **Undo** button is not available, then the undo list has been cleared, and you can no longer undo your last action.

The **Undo** command does not reverse view manipulations; however, the **View** > **Previous** command is still available for that purpose.

**Move Command (Edit Menu)**

Moves items from one location to another. You can specify the locations by clicking the drawing sheet or by entering relative values in the **Move** ribbon. You can move one or multiple items at a time, and you can move select sets. You can access this command from the **Edit** menu or the main toolbar.

If you want to move an item to another drawing, move it to the Stockpile, open the second drawing and place the item from the stockpile.

If you move an item that owns other items, the owned items move also. For example, if you move a vessel that owns trays and nozzles, the trays and nozzles move with the vessel.

You can use other view manipulation commands, such as **Zoom**, **Fit**, and **Pan**, while you are using the **Move** command. When you finish manipulating the view, the software returns you to the **Move** command at the point where you were when you started manipulating the view.

**Move Ribbon**

Specifies the *from point* and *to point* when you move items.

**Copy**

Copies the items in the select set when you move them.

**Step Distance**

Increases or decreases the value in the ribbon boxes. For example, typing a step value of 0.25 and pointing away from the *from point* increases the distance in discrete steps, from 0.25 to 0.5, 0.75, and so forth.

**X**

Allows you to enter an explicit value for the distance to move in the x-coordinate, or you can simply observe the value as you drag the object.

**Y**

Allows you to enter an explicit value for the distance to move in the y-coordinate, or you can simply observe the value as you drag the object.

**Move an Item with the Select Tool**

1. On the main toolbar, select the **Select Tool**

.

1. Position the pointer over the item but not over any of the handles of the item. Dragging a handle modifies the item instead of moving it.
2. Drag the item to its new position.

**Move an item with precision**

1. On the main toolbar, select **Select Tool**.
2. Position the pointer over the item that you want to move, at a location where the software recognizes a keypoint . The pointer snaps to the keypoint thereby making it easier for you to control the exact locus of the move.
3. Drag the item to its new position.

2. Select the items that you want to move into the destination drawing.
3. Select **Edit** > **Move to Drawing**.
4. In the Drawing view, select the *from* point.

For the purposes of placement in the destination drawing, the *from* point becomes the origin of the select set.

While you are using a *from* point (or *to* in the destination drawing), the pointer is a crosshair.

1. If more than one possible destination drawing is open, then select the desired destination drawing from the **Available Drawings** list on the **Move to Drawing** dialog.
2. In the Drawing view of the destination drawing, select the *to* point.

For the **Move to Drawing** command to be available, the following conditions must be met: The source and destination drawing must be open, and neither of these drawings can be read-only.

The drawing objects to be moved must be selected.

The selected items must not have a connection to any items outside the select set.

You must have the appropriate permissions to modify the items in the select set.

Because you have to switch to a different drawing, the **Undo** command is not available for moving a select set to another drawing.

Logical relationships are preserved (for example, loop or package relationships or plant group relationships). Also, if a logical group such as an instrument loop, whose members are all moved to the new drawing, resides in the source drawing stockpile, then that logical group moves to the stockpile of the destination drawing.

**Finding and Replacing Drawing Items**

The software has the ability to find items and inconsistency indicators in your drawing. You can define search criteria based on a catalog item or an item type already in place in your drawing. Or, you can define criteria based on a delivered filter or on a user-defined filter. Having found all drawing items of a certain type, you can modify their properties or reposition them or even replace them with an item of a compatible type.

The software also searches your drawing for inconsistency indicators so that you can review and correct inconsistencies systematically.

Replacing drawing items is straightforward, too. You have the capability to replace a single drawing item with a comparable item, replace many items one-by-one, or even replace all items of one type at the same time.

When you find or replace drawing items, the selected items are added to a select set, and so you can view the common properties of the select set items in the **Properties** window and edit them if appropriate.

The **Find** and **Replace** commands are not available in the **Engineering Data Editor**.

**Select Associated Item Command (Edit Menu)**

When an item note and label is associated with a drawing item and you select the label’s annotation point, this command highlights the associated item. This is useful for example, if you have a number of items with associated labels that are placed remotely from those items, and it is not clear which label belongs to which item.

**Replace Command (Edit Menu)**

Displays the **Find and Replace** dialog, which allows you to replace some or all of the drawing items that match the search criteria defined by the options on the **Find** tab.

When using the Replace option to replace an existing symbol, make sure that the rules applied to the old symbol are also valid for the new symbol and all connected items. Typically the scope of a rule is determined by identification attributes such as the Pipe Run Class. Use extreme caution when replacing a symbol with another symbol that has a slightly different set of rules.

For example, certain off-line instruments or system functions can be placed on a Connect to Process line but not on a Secondary Pipe Run. If replacing a Connect to Process line with Secondary Piping, first remove any instruments that are not supported on a pipe run to make sure that no invalid relationships result.

When replacing a symbol, Pipe Spec and Item Tag validation routines are run for appropriate items.

The **Replace** command does not allow a non-breaking component to be replaced with a break component. Piping components and instruments can be defined in the catalog as break components.

Reducers are good examples of break components. When a break component is placed into a pipe run, the pipe run is automatically broken at that point. A break component suppresses the consistency checking and limits the propagation of the properties that are broken. The **Property Breaks** command in the **Catalog Manager** is used to define a catalog item as a break component.

If an item type property has **Write Modeler** or **Write Both** permissions in Data Dictionary Manager and a symbol belonging to the item type is changed in Catalog Manager, running the **Replace** command will NOT overwrite values assigned to this property with any default that may have been pre-defined in Catalog Manager. If the property permissions are **Write Catalog** in Data Dictionary Manager, **Replace** will restore any default property values defined in Catalog Manager.

Certain symbol properties, such as the item’s **Type**, are hardcoded to be set at the Catalog level. These properties should not be changed at the Modeler level, as this can result in unexpected symbol behavior.

**Replace Mode Command (Tools Menu)**

Controls whether catalog items are placed as substitutions for existing drawing items or placed normally.

When this mode is active, the software places catalog items only when they replace an existing drawing item. When this mode is not active, the software places catalog items as usual. The **Replace Mode** command copies properties of the current item onto the new item.

The **Replace Mode** command works for like objects only. The item that you want to replace in the drawing must be of the same class: equipment class, inline component class, and so forth. For instance, you can replace a vessel with another vessel, but you cannot replace a vessel with a pump. One exception is that the software ignores the instrument class when you replace instruments. The software does look at the value of the **Is Inline** property to prevent an inline instrument being replaced with an offline instrument.

software also takes into consideration the connect points that are in use on the currently placed item. This stipulation means you cannot replace an angled item for a straight item when the straight item is already connected at both ends. For example, you cannot replace a Flanged Nozzle with an Angle Parametric Nozzle if the nozzle is already connected to a pipe run; likewise for angled valves. **Replace Mode** also works on parametrics. Resizing is only maintained during the replace if both symbols have identical variables.

The **Replace Mode** functions very much like **Edit** > **Replace**. However, the replace mode works for only one item at a time and is not activated from inside a dialog.

You cannot use the **Replace Mode** for pipe runs or signal lines. If you need to replace pipe runs or signal lines, use the **Edit** > **Replace** command.

When replacing a symbol, Pipe Spec and Item Tag validation routines are run for appropriate items.

**Find Tab (Find and Replace Dialog)**

Allows you to search the drawing for specified items.

**Find what**

Lists search criteria and allows you to enter new search criteria or select from a list of the five most recently used criteria. The items listed above the dashed line in the list are used to set new search criteria by searching using the **Catalog Item**, **Filter**, **Inconsistency**, or **Redundant Breaks** options. Selecting the **Catalog Item** option opens the **Select Catalog Item** dialog. Selecting the **Filter** option opens the **Select** **Filter** dialog.

**Search in**

Defines the scope of the search. You can search the active drawing or just the contents of the active window (items that are currently visible in the Drawing view). If the **Active Window** option is selected, the **Scroll mode** feature is not available. If the **Active Drawing** option is selected, the **Scroll mode** feature is automatically set to **Zoom**, and you can select a preferred scroll mode.

**Scroll mode**

Defines how the active view should be changed when a drawing item is found. If you select **Zoom**, the active view is zoomed to a multiple of the range of the found drawing item. If you select **Pan**, the active view is shifted without changing the view scale so that the center of the drawing item is in the center of the view.

If **Scroll Mode** feature is turned off, then the active view is left unchanged.

**Direction**

Specifies the direction of the search. Because drawing objects are stored linearly in the database, using either **Next** or **Previous** moves forward or backward through the document.

**Find**

Initiates a search for a single item that is part of the specified search scope. Each time you select **Find**, the software searches for and highlights the next drawing item that matches the defined search criteria in the defined direction. Each time an item is found that matches the **Find what** criteria, the active view is changed based on the **Scroll mode** setting.

**Replace**

Replaces the item selected when you selected **Find**. The **Replace** button is available only when the item found can be replaced by the item defined in the **Replace with** box. Each time you select **Replace**, the located item is replaced, and the **Find** command continues based on the **Direction** setting. As each drawing item is found, the active view is updated based on the **Scroll mode** setting.

**Replace All**

Replaces all items that match the **Find what** criteria with the item defined in the **Replace with** box without prompting you. After all of the replacements are completed, the software reports the number of matches found and the number of replacements that were made. The active view is also updated depending on the **Scroll mode** setting.

**Select Catalog Item Dialog**

Allows you to select a catalog item type for the search criteria when you use the **Find** or **Replace** commands. This dialog is constructed much the same as the **Catalog Explorer** window.

**Tree View**

Displays a hierarchy of nodes that contain catalog items. You can navigate through the tree view by selecting the different nodes. To open a node, select the plus sign to the left of the node name. To close a node, select the minus sign to the left of the node name. If the selected node contains any drawing symbols, the software displays them in the list view.

**List View**

Displays the symbols that are associated with the active node in the tree view. Only the contents of one node appear.

**Navigation Bar**

Allows you to see and use **Catalog Explorer** shortcut buttons to navigate to catalog items more quickly.

**Manipulating Items With Component Handles**

Many components allow you to change their shape or orientation using component handles. Component handles allow you to rotate or mirror a component around axes, and you can use component handles to scale or resize parametric items in a drawing. Items can have several different types of component handles.

The **mirror handle** allows you to mirror about the horizontal and vertical axes, defined in relation to the origin of the item. You can mirror items by dragging the mirror handle in the appropriate direction.

The software shows you the result of the operation dynamically so that you can be sure to mirror the item correctly.

The **rotate handle** provides a mechanism for rotating components around their origin. You can rotate items by dragging the rotate handle in the appropriate direction. The software shows you the result of the operation dynamically so that you can be sure to rotate the item correctly.

**Parametric handles** allow you to modify different parts of parametric items. Standard parametric handles represent up to four driving dimensions that have been applied to an item. Parametric handles can be located in four standard positions: top center, bottom center, left center, and right center of the range of an item. You can scale the item parametrically by dragging any parametric handle. The software shows you the result of the operation dynamically so that you can be sure to scale the item correctly.

**Scale handles** allow you to change the scale of a drawing item. A scalable symbol displays four solid square scale handles. A handle is displayed at each corner of the range of the symbol. You can drag any one of the handles, and the symbol scales either larger or smaller depending on the direction that you drag the handle.

Not all drawing items in can be mirrored, rotated, or scaled. Catalog Manager defines these properties for items when the symbols for the items are created. Note also that select sets cannot be mirrored or rotated with component handles. The **Mirror** and **Rotate** commands on the toolbar can be used for select sets.

**Scale a Parametric Item**

1. Select the parametric drawing item that you want to resize.
2. Drag one of the parametric handles in the middle of each side of the item to change the size of the item.
3. Continue dragging the parametric handles until the item is the size that you want.

Certain properties of the parametric item, such as angle values, remain the same when you resize it.

**Scale a Drawing Item**

1. Select your scalable item in the Drawing view.

A scalable symbol includes four solid square scale handles . A handle is displayed at each corner of the range of the symbol.

Scalable symbols are created by setting the **IsScalable** property of the symbol to **True** in Catalog Manager.

1. Drag any one of the handles to make the symbol either larger or smaller, depending on the direction that you drag the handle.

**Mirror Command (Edit Menu)**

Reflects one or more selected items about a line or axis that you define. You can mirror without copying, or mirror and copy.

To mirror an item using a defined mirror axis, select **Mirror**

on the main toolbar. The software reflects

one or more selected items about that axis. You can mirror the item itself, or you can make a copy of the item in the mirrored position.

You can also use mirror handles. The mirror handle appears at the upper right of the item. For example, dragging a mirror handle across an x- or y-axis causes the item to appear mirrored about its center.

Mirroring is displayed dynamically so that you can see the result of your action before you release the item to place it.

**Mirror Ribbon**

Appears on the main toolbar when the **Mirror** command is active, and allows you to either specify mirroring options or to observe mirroring options.

**Copy**

Copies the item or items when you mirror them.

**Position Angle**

Sets the angle of the mirror axis. The origin of the angle measurement is the point that you selected for the beginning of the mirror axis. Setting the position angle to zero extends the axis horizontally to the right of the screen, 90 extends the axis vertically to the top, 180 extends the axis horizontally to the left, and 270

extends the axis vertically to the bottom.

**Mirror an Item Using Its Mirror Handle**

is, as you move your pointer).

1. Position the pointer so that the mirrored items appear where you want them, and then click. If you want to copy the mirrored items, hold CTRL when you click to place your items.

Instead of positioning the mirror axis dynamically, you can use the **Position Angle** box on the **Mirror** ribbon.

You can use other view manipulation commands, such as **Zoom** and **Pan**, while you are using the **Mirror** command. When you finish manipulating the view, the software returns you to the **Mirror** command at the point where you were when you started manipulating the view.

If an actuator is upside down when placed on an instrument valve, then use **Rotate** or **Mirror** to align the actuator in the appropriate position.

1. By dragging the pointer over the item, locate a mirror axis. The mirrored items are displayed dynamically on the other side of the mirror axis.
2. Position the pointer so that the mirrored items appear where you want them, and then click. You can use other view manipulation commands, such as **Zoom** and **Pan**, while you are using **Mirror**. When you finish manipulating the view, the software returns you to **Mirror** at the point where you were when you started manipulating the view.
3. If an actuator is upside down when placed on an instrument valve, you can use **Mirror** to align the actuator in the appropriate position.

**Rotate Command (Edit Menu)**

Rotates one or more items a precise distance or angle about a specified point.

To rotate an item, select the item and then select **Rotate**. To define the rotation axis, you must specify two points by clicking in the drawing.

**First Click**

Defines the rotation point.

**Second Click**

Defines the rotation handle.

The software then dynamically displays a reference axis for the rotation. If you want to define a precise location for the rotation, you can enter values in the **Rotate** ribbon. You can enter increments in the **Step** **Angle** box if you want to control the increments of the rotation. For example, if the box is set to 30.0, the rotation is displayed in 30 degree increments. The default setting is 0 degrees so that the rotation is fully dynamic, that is, it can take on any value. The **Rotation Angle** box on the ribbon displays the angle of change between the old and new position. Angles are always displayed as a positive value.

**Third Click**

Completes the rotation of the item.

Also, you can rotate an item about its center with the rotate component handle . Keeping the rotate component handle close to the center of an item causes the item to rotate at 90 degree increments.

Dragging the rotate component handle further away from the center of the item causes the item to rotate at smaller angles. The angle increments become smaller the farther away your pointer is from the center of rotation.

**Rotate Ribbon**

Appears when the **Rotate** command is active, and allows you to either observe rotation options as you rotate an item or specify rotation options.

**Copy**

Creates a copy of the item that you are rotating.

**Position Angle**

Displays the angle between the horizontal axis through the center of rotation (A) and the point that you rotate from (B). Then, if you rotate the item, the position angle (C) changes to become the angle between the horizontal axis and the point to which you rotate. The position angle is always a positive value measured counter-clockwise from the axis.

**Rotation Angle**

Defines the rotation angle. The rotation angle is the angle between the point from which you rotate and the point to which you rotate. In the following picture, the center of rotation (A) shows the point (B) from which you rotate the item.

The rotation angle (C) is the angle of change between the old and new positions of the rotated item. The value is always positive.

**Step Angle**

Specifies the rotation step angle. The step angle specifies the increments, in degrees, that an item rotates on a rotation axis. You can enter increments in the **Step Angle** box. For example, if the box is set to 30.0, the rotation is displayed in 30 degree increments. The default setting is 0 degrees so that the rotation is fully dynamic.

**Rotate an Item Using Its Rotate Handle**

1. Select an item in the drawing.
2. Click the rotate handle .
3. Drag the rotate handle in the direction that you want to rotate the item.

You can click the rotate handle closer to or further from the center of the item to change the step angle for the rotation.

You can rotate items using the **Rotate** button

on the main toolbar, too.

**Rotate an Item About an Axis You Define**

1. Select one or more items.
2. On the main toolbar, select **Rotate**

.

1. Click at the center of rotation.
2. Then, click to define the other end of the rotation axis.

The software dynamically displays the rotation axis and items being rotated. The location and position of the rotation axis defines the rotation *from point*.

1. Rotate the items into position by dragging the rotation axis.
2. Click to define the rotation *to point*.

To rotate by arbitrary increments, type a value in the **Step Angle** box on the Rotate Ribbon.

In order to copy the rotated items into the new position, you can hold CTRL while you click to define the *to point*.

You can use other view manipulation commands, such as **Zoom** and **Pan**, while you are using the **Rotate** command. When you finish manipulating the view, the software returns you to the **Rotate** command at the point that you were when you started manipulating the view.

**Cutting or Deleting Items**

You can delete items from a drawing by selecting them and then selecting **Cut** or **Delete** on the main toolbar or pressing **Delete** on the keyboard. Selecting **Cut** places the selected item on the Clipboard.

The properties of an item affect what happens when you cut or delete it. If the item has a **TagReqdFlag** property of **True**, which you set in Catalog Manager, and its item type is included in the **StockpileItems** group, which you set in Options Manager, the item may be deleted to a stockpile. In addition, in order for pipe runs, duct runs, or signal runs to be deleted to a stockpile, the **Pipeline** **Name Attributes**, **DuctRun Name Attributes**, or **Signal Name Attributes** data settings respectively must have at least one property defined in Options Manager, at least one of those properties must be populated for the drawing item, and the combination of values for those properties must be unique for drawing items of that type in the plant - if the values of those properties are not unique for an item, that item gets deleted from the model. When selecting **Delete** on the toolbar or pressing the **Delete** key, the deletion behavior depends on the **Delete Key Default Behavior** setting in Options Manager: **Delete to Plant Stockpile**, **Delete to Drawing Stockpile**, or **Delete from Model**. The data associated with the item remains in the database.

If the **TagReqdFlag** property is **False** or the item type is not included in the **StockpileItems** group, when you cut or delete the item, it is removed from the drawing and the database.

Off-page and utility connectors are always placed in the Stockpile when deleted regardless of the **TagReqdFlag** property.

You can press **Delete** on the keyboard to remove an item or a select set from the drawing. First, select the item or group of items in the drawing. Then you must point to the Drawing view before you press **Delete**. The software does not delete the item or group of items if the pointer is located anywhere outside the Drawing view.

You can delete an item by selecting and right-clicking it. If you select **Delete from Model**, the selected item is deleted from the drawing and from the database, regardless of the properties set in Catalog Manager or Options Manager.

**Delete Command (Main Toolbar)**

Deletes the selected element and any relationships and dimensions that have been placed on it. You cannot reinsert or paste elements deleted with this command. However, you can retrieve the data by immediately selecting **Undo**.

The properties of an item affect what happens when you cut or delete it. If the item has a **TagReqdFlag** property of **True**, which you set in Catalog Manager, and its item type is included in the **StockpileItems** group, which you set in Options Manager, the item may be deleted to a stockpile. In addition, in order for pipe runs, duct runs, or signal runs to be deleted to a stockpile, the **Pipeline** **Name Attributes**, **DuctRun Name Attributes**, or **Signal Name Attributes** data settings respectively must have at least one property defined in Options Manager, at least one of those properties must be populated for the drawing item, and the combination of values for those properties must be unique for drawing items of that type in the plant - if the values of those properties are not unique for an item, that item gets deleted from the model. When selecting **Delete** on the toolbar or pressing the **Delete** key, the deletion behavior depends on the **Delete Key Default Behavior** setting in Options Manager: **Delete to Plant Stockpile**, **Delete to Drawing Stockpile**, or **Delete from Model**. The data associated with the item remains in the database.

If the **TagReqdFlag** property is **False** or the item type is not included in the **StockpileItems** group, when you cut or delete the item, it is removed from the drawing and the database.

**Delete to Stockpile Commands (Edit Menu)**

You can select **Delete** on the main toolbar or press **Delete** on the keyboard to remove an item or a group of items from the drawing, too. First, select the item or items in the drawing. Then you must place the pointer in the Drawing view and press **Delete**. The software does not delete the item if the pointer is located anywhere outside the Drawing view. When deleting items in this way, the deletion behavior depends on properties set in Catalog Manager and Options Manager (see Notes).

You can also delete an item from the model when it is already in a stockpile. Select the item in the **Engineering Data Editor**, and select the **Delete Stockpile Item** command on the **Stockpile** menu of the **Engineering Data Editor**.

The properties of an item affect what happens when you cut or delete it. If the item has a **TagReqdFlag** property of **True**, which you set in Catalog Manager, and its item type is included in the **StockpileItems** group, which you set in Options Manager, the item may be deleted to a stockpile. In addition, in order for pipe runs, duct runs, or signal runs to be deleted to a stockpile, the **Pipeline** **Name Attributes**, **DuctRun Name Attributes**, or **Signal Name Attributes** data settings respectively must have at least one property defined in Options Manager, at least one of those properties must be populated for the drawing item, and the combination of values for those properties must be unique for drawing items of that type in the plant - if the values of those properties are not unique for an item, that item gets deleted from the model. When selecting **Delete** on the toolbar or pressing the **Delete** key, the deletion behavior depends on the **Delete Key Default Behavior** setting in Options Manager: **Delete to Plant Stockpile**, **Delete to Drawing Stockpile**, or **Delete from Model**. The data associated with the item remains in the database.

If the **TagReqdFlag** property is **False** or the item type is not included in the **StockpileItems** group, when you cut or delete the item, it is removed from the drawing and the database.

If you want to delete the item, its location in the drawing, and its properties in the database, right-click the item and on the shortcut menu, select **Delete from Model**. See Remove an Item from the Model.

When you delete inline components, the software automatically mends the pipe or signal run.

**Delete from Model Command (Edit Menu)**

Deletes the selected item from the database; if you are deleting a connector, then its partner is deleted from the stockpile as well.

Unlike the **Delete to Stockpile** commands, which move the selected item to the plant or drawing stockpile, this command removes the selected items or connector and its partner from the data model completely.

In the case of the connector, the command is not available unless the partner connector is in one of the stockpiles.

After deleting an item from the model, you can restore it to the drawing using the **Undo** command, unless you have performed one of the actions that clears the Undo buffer. See Undo Command (Edit

Menu).

**Remove an Item from the Model**

1. In the Drawing view, select **Edit** > **Delete from Model**.
2. Save the drawing. After removing an item from the model, no data associated with the item remains in the database.

You can delete a select set from the model by choosing the items and then right-clicking on any member of the set to display the shortcut menu.

You can also delete an item from the model when it is already in a stockpile. Select the item in the **Engineering Data Editor**, and then select **Delete Stockpile Item** on the **Stockpile** menu of the **Engineering Data Editor**.

You can only remove items from the plant model that do not share a relationship with another drawing.

For example, a connector can only be removed from the plant model if its partner connector is in one of the stockpiles and not in another drawing.

When you delete inline components, the software automatically mends the pipe or signal run.

**Copying Items**

Copying an item makes it possible to use a drawing item that is already in place as a starting point for placing a new item, without removing the current item from the drawing. Several methods exist for doing this, such as using the **Copy** button on the main toolbar or using CTRL while you move, mirror, or rotate a drawing item.

Remember that placement rules are in effect when you are copying an item to a new location, just as they are when you originally place an item from a stockpile or from **Catalog Explorer**. So a copied nozzle must be placed on a piece of equipment, for instance.

**Copy Command (Edit Menu)**

Copies selected items to the Clipboard. This command replaces the previous contents of the Clipboard with the new contents.

**Copy an Item**

1. Select an item.
2. On the main toolbar, select **Copy**

.

After you copy an item, it is placed on the Clipboard. Then you can use **Paste** to place it on the drawing. You can only paste the item in another application and not in a Smart P&ID drawing.

When you paste the item, the software frequently pastes it on top of the item that you copied. To see the pasted item, drag it to its new location in the drawing.

You can also copy an item with the **Move** command. Select the item, select **Move** on the toolbar, and press CTRL as you place the item in the drawing. You can do the same with a select set.

**Copy an Item with the Select Tool**

1. Select **Select Tool**

on the main toolbar.

1. Select an item.
2. Position the pointer over the item, but not over any of the handles of the item.
3. Hold CTRL and drag the copy to its new location. Placement rules are in effect, and so you must place the copy in an allowed position as if it were a new catalog item.

**Selecting Connected Items**

You can use the **Select Connected Items** command to navigate the line connectivity from a selected line segment to add components and other runs to a select set based on matching properties. In cases where you want the software to continue constructing a select set beyond a break in a line, for example, a nozzle, this command makes it possible to accomplish that goal.

This functionality is useful for finding branches from runs and finding all the runs and components on an entire drawing that have a common property value.

After the items are selected in the drawing, it is then a simple matter to choose the select set in the **Properties** window and continuing editing properties for not only runs, but also lines and networks and all runs included in the drawing.

The properties that define a run are specified in Options Manager.

**Select Connected Items Command (Edit Menu)**

Opens the Select Connected Items Dialog, which allows you to create a select set that includes the active

line and disconnected lines and inline components in any network. This command is available only when either a single line segment or a single component is selected on the drawing; however, after the dialog is open, you can change the selected item in the drawing and change the scope of the select set freely.

**Select Connected Items Dialog**

Allows you to construct a select set from lines and inline components, even if there are breaks in a network.

This dialog remains open until you dismiss it, and you can highlight items in the drawing and manipulate members of the select set while the dialog is active. The **Select Connected Items** command, which appears both on the **Edit** menu and on the **Line Shortcut** menu, is available only when a single line segment or a single component is selected.

**Scope**

Provides options for defining the extent of your select set. The **Scope List** allows you to choose extent, and the **Include Runs** and **Include Components** buttons allow you to incorporate different items into the select set. At no time can neither the **Include Runs** nor **Include Components** buttons be selected; that is, one or the other or both is always active.

**Scope List**

Allows you to choose from **Run**, **Line**, **Network**, and **Drawing**. The **Run** option means that lines in a single run are selected. The **Line** option selects runs that are connected at end points, including components. The **Network** option adds branches, and the **Drawing** option selects all the runs and inline components in the open drawing. The default value for this list is **Line**.

**Include Runs**

Incorporates lines into the select set.

**Include Components**

Adds inline components into the select set.

**Matching Properties**

1. Use the **Selected Items** list in the **Properties** window to display the common properties for the select

set. See Customize the Properties Window.

If you select **Cancel**, the Select Connected Items Dialog closes, and the original item is selected in the drawing.

**Modifying Item Properties**

When you use the design software to produce drawings, it is important to be able to specify and change the properties of the items that you place in your diagram. You can review and edit the properties of an item in the **Properties** window. You can open the **Engineering Data Editor** of the drawing data and in the cells of the table, edit properties of items that belong to the active drawing, other drawings, and stockpiles. You can edit the contents of some cells directly in the table if the corresponding property is not read-only or generated strictly by validation; you can copy, cut, and paste properties, too, with the same restriction. In the **Properties** window you are also constrained to edit only those properties that are not read-only.

After you have populated the properties of an item you can, for instance, run reports that display the items and their properties, or create filters and control Drawing views so that only items with specified properties are displayed, or you can label items so that their properties are displayed graphically.

**Modify Pump Properties by Importing a Smart P&ID Report**

1. Open a drawing that includes a pump.
2. Run the **Equipment List** report. See Generate a Report for an Active Drawing.
3. In the resulting report, change the property values as needed by updating the cells in the appropriate columns. If a property does not appear in the report, you can add it to the report template. See Define the Contents of Your Report Template.
4. Select **File** > **Save**.
5. Select **File** > **Close**.
6. In Smart P&ID, select **File** > **Import** > **Data File**.
7. Browse to the **Equipment List** report that you just created and modified.
8. Select **Open**.

**Editing Plant Group Properties**

When an item is placed in a drawing, the plant group type and the plant group name under which the drawing resides are assigned to the item by default. However, if you want to assign a different plant group type or plant group name to it, you can do that either from the **Engineering Data Editor** or from the **Properties** window.

You can assign a different value only to the plant group name, retaining the existing value for the plant group type. But if you assign a different value to the plant group type, plant group name is also assigned.

Based on the plant group type you select, the system assigns the first value in the corresponding plant group names list as the plant group name. For example, in the following plant group hierarchy, we have three types of plant groups – plant, area and unit.

Consider a plant item placed under **\A2\U3** which indicates that the plant group type of the item is **Unit** and the default plant group properties assigned are:

**Plant Group Type** - **A2**

**Plant Group Name** - **U3**

Now if you select the plant group type as **Area**, then** A1** is assigned as the plant group name, as **A1** will be the first name appearing in the plant group names list when you select **Area** as the plant group type.

However, you can modify it by selecting desired value from the list.

The **Plant Group Name** property is dependent on the **Plant Group Type** property and hence the **Plant** **Group Name** property cannot be assigned until the **Plant Group Type** property is assigned. If you remove the **Plant Group Type** property, then **Plant Group Name** property is also removed.

Both the **Plant Group Type** and **Plant Group Name** properties have to be assigned for an item, therefore if the **Plant Group Type** property is assigned and the **Plant Group Name** property is not available or removed for an item, the software removes the **Plant Group Type** value as follows: **Active drawing and stockpile view**: Whether the change is made in the **Properties** window or in the **Engineering Data Editor**, the **Plant Group Type** value is not removed while in the same drawing session. Refreshing the **Engineering Data Editor** does not remove the **Plant Group Type** value.

Only closing the drawing removes the **Plant Group Type** value.

**Other drawing**: If **Pagination** is enabled in **Engineering Data Editor**, then toggling the **Other** **Drawing** view removes the **Plant Group Type** value. If **Pagination** is not enabled, then refreshing the **Engineering Data Editor** removes the **Plant Group Type** value.

When copying and pasting data between cells in the **Engineering Data Editor** where one property is dependent upon another, the higher dependent (parent) property must be in a column to the left of the https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

dependency (child) property in the layout. For example, if copying both **Fluid System** and **Fluid Code** property values from one row to one or more other rows in the **Engineering Data Editor**, **Fluid System** must be located to the left of **Fluid Code** in the layout. Likewise, if copying **Plant Group Type** and **Plant** **Group Name** properties, **Plant Group Type** must be located to the left of **Plant Group Name** in the layout.

Opens when you click inside the **Insulation Spec** property box and then select the ellipsis . Use it to specify an insulation specification for the selected item or items. You can choose a specification from the **All** list** **or the** Matching **list.

**Matching**

Lists all insulation specifications that match any already chosen values, such as **Insulation Type** or **Insulation Purpose**.

**All**

Lists all the insulation specifications in the plant insulation specification file.

The path to the plant insulation specification file is defined in Options Manager. Any modifications to insulation specifications are carried out in Insulation Specification Manager.

**Assign an Insulation Specification**

1. Select the item that you want to add an insulation specification to.
2. Select the **Insulation Spec** property box in the **Properties** window.
3. Select the **Calculation** button .
4. On the Insulation Spec Dialog, choose a specification from either the **Matching** or the **All** lists.

If you have already specified other insulation properties, such as the insulation temperature, type, or purpose, then the **Matching** list contains only those insulation specifications that agree with the properties already chosen; nonetheless, you can choose a specification from the **All** list.

The selected **Insulation Spec** value determines the values of the **Insulation Purpose**, **Insulation** **Density**, and **Insulation Type** properties. To edit these properties manually, the **Insulation Spec** property value must first be cleared (doing so clears all the insulation properties except for **Insulation** **Nominal Diameter** and **Insulation Temperature**).

If you assign a heat tracing to an item before you assign insulation properties, your choices of insulation properties and specifications are restricted.

them from the model altogether.

You view the items in a stockpile in the **Engineering Data Editor**. In particular select **Stockpile**  to view items in the Stockpile, or select **Active Drawing Stockpile**  to view items in the stockpile of the active drawing. Be sure that the other item buttons on the **Engineering Data Editor** toolbar (that is, the **Active** **Drawing** or **Other Drawings** buttons) are not active when you want to view stockpile items alone.

In the **Engineering Data Editor**, the **Actions** menu contains the following commands for manipulating stockpile items:

Delete Stockpile Item Command

Move to Different Stockpile Command

You can also access these commands from the shortcut menu, which opens when you right-click in the **Engineering Data Editor**. See Engineering Data Editor Shortcut Menu.

You have the capability to place an item from a stockpile directly onto an open drawing. You enter placement mode when you click the icon associated with a stockpile item in the left-most column of the **Engineering Data Editor**.

You can import items into the Stockpile, too, by importing reports with the **File** > ** Import** > **Data File** command on the main toolbar.

**Move to Different Stockpile Dialog**

Opens when you right-click a stockpile item icon in the **Engineering Data Editor** and select **Move to** **Different Stockpile**. You can move your selected stockpile item into the drawing stockpile of another drawing.

**Tree view**

Allows you to navigate in the plant hierarchy to display the drawing into which stockpile you want to move the selected item.

**List view**

Displays a list of available drawings that can accept the selected stockpile item.

**Place an Item from a Stockpile**

1. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, select the icon in the left most column for the stockpile item that you want to place.
2. Click the drawing at the position where you want to place the item. If the item you place has multiple orientations in relation to other items, you can use the Configuration (QuickPick) tool to select the appropriate placement for the item. See Place an Item with the Configuration (QuickPick) Tool.

You can enter values for properties of the placed item by selecting the item, and then selecting **Edit** > **Properties** to display the **Properties** window.

You cannot use **Replace Mode**

to replace drawing items with items from the **Engineering Data**

**Editor**.

**Move a Stockpile Item to the Stockpile of Another Drawing**

1. In the left-most column of the** Engineering Data Editor**, right-click the icon of the stockpile item that you want to move. Be sure you have chosen a stockpile item in your** Engineering Data Editor**, not a drawing item.
2. On the shortcut menu, select **Move to Different Stockpile** to display the Move to Different Stockpile

Dialog.

1. Choose a drawing from the list and select **OK**.

Plant item groups, such as instrument loops, packages, safety classes, and so forth, frequently reside in a stockpile with their members residing on drawings. Moving the plant item group itself to another stockpile has special limitations:

**From a drawing stockpile to the Stockpile**: No constraints apply. This action can occur at any time.

**From the Stockpile to a drawing stockpile**: If the plant item group contains only items in the destination drawing or does not contain items in any drawing, this action is allowed.

**From a drawing stockpile to another drawing stockpile**:** **Same constraint as above applies.

**Using Reports to Import Items into the Stockpile**

You can use the Equipment List and the Pipe Run List to import new items into the stockpile. This capability allows you to define values for an item that does not yet exist in the database. Both of these reports have hidden columns that store some key information that is necessary for importing this information.

Also, you can use a report to import information for items that already exist in the database. You must first run the report, add or edit property values for the items returned in the report, and then import the items back into the drawing. The property values for the items are updated. Valid reports are Equipment List, Equipment Nozzle List, and Pipe Run List.

The status bar at the bottom of the Smart P&ID window displays the progress of the import activity.

You can populate the stockpile with items from Aspen Basic Engineering exported spreadsheets and some Smart P&ID reports.

1. On the **Import Log** dialog, you can select **Report** to open the log file and view notes on the import process, or you can select **Close**.

If a format change is made to an exported Aspen Basic Engineering report, you must make modifications to the import code to accommodate the changed report layout.

Aspen Basic Engineering spreadsheets in either Microsoft Excel or XML format are supported. These spreadsheets include the Vessel Equipment List, Pump Equipment List, and Heat Exchanger Equipment.

Stockpile items that come from importing Aspen Basic Engineering data can be easily updated by re-importing a data file. Previously imported items, whether they remain in the stockpile or have already been placed in the drawing, are updated with data from the newly imported file.

Importing Aspen Basic Engineering XML data files allows greater flexibility when importing data into the software. All three reports: Equipment, Pumps, and Exchangers, are included in a single XML

report so that only one file has to be imported.

You can use the Equipment List, Pipe Run List, and Equipment Nozzle List Reports to define properties of items already placed in the drawing, too. Items must have an assigned item tag prior to definition or modification of properties. In addition, these reports can create occurrences of items in the stockpile.

For more information on import code and other importing parameters, see *Import Implementation* *Customization* in the Smart P&ID Programmer’s Help.

**Create a New Pump by Importing a Smart P&ID Report into the Stockpile** 1. Open a drawing that includes a pump with an item tag, for example, **P-100A**.

1. Run the **Equipment List** report. See Generate a Report for an Active Drawing.
2. In the resulting report, change the value in the **Item Tag** cell by highlighting the last column in the report and the column right next to it, then selecting **Format** > **Column** > **Unhide**. The path name of the associated symbol is available in column **T**. Columns **Y**, **Z**, and **AA** display the **Tag Prefix**, **Tag** **Sequence Number**, and **Tag Suffix** properties, respectively.

Importing new pipe runs using the **Pipe Run List** report is a little different because it also includes **SP_ID** and **Fluid Code** columns. The method above is valid, but you must be careful with row copy and paste because the layout is a little different. Additionally, you must clear the **SP_ID** value.

The delivered **Item Tag** format for pipe runs is *unit code - tag sequence number - tag suffix - fluid* *code*.

**Typicals**

A typical is a user defined, graphical representation, of a group of objects and their relationships. On a drawing, a typical marks the position of where similar groups of objects should appear but have been hidden from view. For example, on a drawing a typical that contains a series of pipes, a pump, and valves, informs the viewer that at this position on the drawing there is more than one group of objects that consist of a series of pipes, a pump, and valves, but have been hidden from view to make the reading of the drawing clearer. To know exactly what the hidden objects are the viewer needs to switch views, from the primary view to the typical view. In the typical view the viewer sees all the typicals and their attributes. Though only the primary typical appears on the primary view, all the typicals and their relationships with the primary view are maintained. A typical can be repeated any number of times and can contain any objects/symbols depicted in the P&ID symbol catalog used to convey the logical plant model, including off-page connectors.

You cannot place or view the auxiliary graphics on the Typical layer.

**Typicals Common Tasks**

The following tasks are used for Typicals in Smart P&ID.

**Create a Typical**

This procedure shows you how to create a Typical from items on a drawing. See Create a Typical.

**Select a View**

When creating a typical after selecting the **Create Typical** command, the software automatically switches to the typical view. This procedure shows you how to switch between the primary and typical views, to view

already created typicals, and how to view the primary and typical views at the same time. See Select a

View.

**Associate a Non-Freestanding Item with a Typical**

When selecting items for creating a typical the software does not allow non-freestanding items to be included in the typical. For example, selecting a pipe run with a nozzle that connects to a vessel, only the pipe run is moved to the typical. This procedure shows you how to move a non-freestanding item, such as a

nozzle, to the typical view and attach it to an existing typical, such as a pipe run. See Associate a Non-

Freestanding Item with a Typical.

**Move an Object from One View to Another**

This procedure shows you how to move an object from one view to another. You use this procedure to add or remove items to an existing typical. This procedure does not work when you have **Both** selected as the view. See Move an Object from One View to Another.

**Comparing Drawings and Typicals**

You can compare between different versions of a drawing and its typicals using the **Tools** > **Compare and** **Refresh** command in Smart P&ID (after creating a new version in Smart P&ID Drawing Manager), or the **Version and Compare** functions of Smart P&ID Drawing Manager. See *Working with Drawing Versions and* *Revisions* in the *<*  aProduct> Drawing Manager Help and Comparing and Refreshing Versions.

**Print a Typical View**

**Gapping Lines**

A gap in a drawing is a condition that exists when two lines intersect graphically in the drawing but not physically in the plant. To portray this condition, you can specify that lines show a gap at these non-physical intersections. This procedure can improve the clarity of your drawing considerably.

You can either turn auto-gapping on, and the software gaps your lines automatically as you route them, or you can choose when the software performs gapping on your drawing by using the **Gap Now** command.

Using the **Gap Now** command, instead of turning on auto-gapping, can increase the efficiency of your design session.

Symbology and priority for your line gaps is set in Options Manager.

Gapping is carried out according to the visible pipes in the current view: only pipes in the primary view are gapped if the primary view is active, and only pipes in the typical view are gapped if the typical view is active. When both views are active, gapping is disabled.

**AutoGap Command (Tools Menu)**

Turns automatic gapping on or off in the drawing. Gapping refers to the condition that exists when two lines intersect graphically on the drawing but do not physically intersect in the plant.

When **AutoGap** is on, the software automatically gaps drawings during the working session each time that you modify an item, when you print, or when you save a file. A progress indicator at the bottom of the window alerts you to avoid selecting another command while the software completes the gapping. The **Gap** **Now** command does not affect the setting for **AutoGap**.

**System Editing**

System Editing allows propagation of property values between related items. If you select **Tools** > System

Editing and a check mark displays by the command, the function is active. You can also turn on System Editing by selecting . When the command is active and you make changes to a drawing, those changes are propagated according to relationships and rules. If the **Enable System Editing** setting is set to **Yes** in Options Manager, then every P&ID drawing in the plant will have System Editing enabled. You can turn System Editing off but when you turn it back on, it does not attempt to propagate any prior drawing changes.

When a new item is placed from the Catalog or the Stockpile or an existing item is modified, creating a new relationship, property values flow across the new relationship as specified in the rules.

If you use Plant Editing to change a property value in a non-active drawing, propagation occurs according to the System Editing rules defined for the plant and the **Engineering Data Editor** display is automatically updated.System Editing is not supported from or to plant item groups such as loops and packages.

The flow of property values is as follows.

**Properties -** The properties that can flow across this relationship are those that are listed as consistency criteria in all of the applicable rules.

**Copy and Propagate -** A property value can be copied in either direction across the new relationship and is propagated outward.

For new items, existing values are not overwritten by this process unless one item contains a Null property value. For example, if different nominal diameter values exit on both sides of a new connection, the existing nominal diameter values are not automatically changed to match unless one of the values is set to Null.

When a directional property, for example, Flow Direction and Slope Direction, is propagated, it is not enough to set the same value on all items the propagation scope. The direction of the underlying geometry must be compared to the direction of the geometry of the start item. One of the possible property values must be selected based on the direction of the geometry. In cases where the direction of the geometry cannot be compared (such as a midpoint branch condition) no propagation is possible.

**The Scope of System Editing**

**Connectivity**

All objects that are connected to the selected object are candidates for inclusion in the propagation (System Editing) process.

**Rules**

The consistency criteria specified in rules define which properties are propagated and in which direction.

The propagations scope can be expanded across a relationship if there is an applicable rule for the property being modified.

**Inconsistencies**

The propagation scope is not expanded past an existing inconsistency for the property being modified.

Using **System Editing** does not resolve inconsistencies. You must resolve the inconsistency.

**Breaks (Break Labels)**

Propagation breaks can be defined for specified properties at specified relationships in a design. The propagation scope is not expanded past a break for the property being modified. For this reason, placement of these at an early stage of the data input process could be helpful.

**Break Components**

Components can be defined with an option to break the nominal diameter or with a filter defining other specified properties that will break at that item. The propagation scope is not expanded past a break component for the property being modified.

**Access Control**

When working in a project, the propagation scope only includes objects that have been claimed.

**Highlighting**

All items that will be changed when a user is ready to change a certain property (clicking in a particular property field in the **Properties** window or picking a solution in the **Consistency Check Solutions** list) will be highlighted so that the user can see the scope of the items for which the particular property will be changed. This scope can vary according to the particular property being modified.

When making a graphical selection of a pipe route, initially only the connector piece of a pipe run is highlighted. However, because the data is stored by pipe run, even if system editing is switched off, the entire pipe run will have its data changed. To see how far a particular pipe run extends, you can turn system editing off and select in the **Properties** window on any property of that pipe run. The software will then highlight the entire pipe run.

**System Editing and Consistency Checking**

You can effectively propagate a changed property value across drawing boundaries. If a changed property value is propagated and it reaches an OPC, it simply stops at that point. An inconsistency indicator at the OPC shows that the value in the active drawing is inconsistent with the value on the connected pipe in the continuation drawing. To resolve this type of inconsistency, the user must open the continuation drawing.

With the continuation drawing open, the user can double-click on the inconsistency indicator to display the **Consistency Check** dialog. One of the solutions available for resolving inconsistencies is to copy the property value from the first drawing into the active drawing. When this solution is used, the property value from the pipe run in the first drawing is copied to the pipe run in the active drawing and spreads outward from there according to the standard propagation rules. Thus, property values can be propagated across document boundaries.

**Inconsistencies**

System Editing never expands across an inconsistency for the property being propagated. For a given set of connected items with a consistent property value, System Editing allows you to easily change that value to a new value. However, if the items are not consistent to begin with (inconsistencies exist), then System Editing will not automatically make them consistent. Other tools are available (such as **Solutions** on the **Consistency Check** dialog) for resolving inconsistencies.

**Break Components**

Some components inherently limit the copying and suppress the consistency checking of certain properties.

For example, a reducer is a break component for the Nominal Diameter property. When changing the Nominal Diameter in a pipeline, the spread of that change is limited by any reducers that exist in that pipeline. The consistency checking that would normally be done between the connected pipes is also suppressed at the reducer.

A break component can be created for any property or collection of properties of a pipe run. To create a break component, you must first create a special filter. This filter must apply to pipe runs and must include the properties to be broken as criteria in the filter. The value for each property in the filter is not important.

Then, you have to open the symbol in **Catalog Manager** and select the **Property Breaks** command to select the filter.

When using a nozzle as a break component, the properties to be broken need to be added to the Piping Point item type in Data Dictionary Manager. Also, the ‘Process Pipe Run To Nozzle’ rule in Rule Manager (under **Plant Rules** > **Relationship** > **Piping**) needs to be modified by adding the required properties for Piping Point 1 of the nozzle to the consistency checks.

For more details, see under the section Creating Property Breaks in Catalog Manager Help.

After creating a break component, when it is placed into a drawing, it breaks the specified properties.

A nozzle cannot be used as a break component for the **Nominal Diameter** property.

Smart P&ID allows pipe runs to be associated with a different plant group other than the one the drawing resides in. If you break the pipe run by inserting a break component such as a reducer, both pipe runs will retain the original value of the Plant Group ID property (it is not changed to the plant group the drawing resides in).

**Break Labels**

The consistency criteria specified in the rules define the general behavior of the properties. Break labels provide a way to define exceptions to the general rules. A break label provides a visible and plottable symbol that signifies the end of one property value condition and the beginning of a new condition along a pipe. A changed property value is never propagated across a break label for that property. A break label also suppresses consistency checking for the property it breaks.

A break label can be created for any property or collection of properties of a pipe run. A break label is created in the **Catalog Manager** just like any other label, except that the **Label Type** property is set to **Attribute Break**. A SmartText field must be created for each property that is to be broken. In many cases the graphical shape of the label indicates which properties are broken. In these cases the Visible flag on the SmartText is set to False so that the text is not visible. It is also normal to turn the leader line on within the Catalog Manager so that it is automatically displayed at placement time. All of the symbols under Piping\Segment Breaks in the delivered catalog are break labels.

A break label can only be placed at a point where the specified properties are listed in the consistency criteria for the applicable rules. The break label stays attached to the point it was placed on and cannot be dragged away from it.

**System Editing and Projects**

When working in a project, the system enforces the rule that unclaimed objects cannot be modified. If you select an unclaimed object, the **Properties** window does not allow you to enter new values for its properties. Similarly, System Editing does not allow property values to flow to unclaimed objects.

If you have a claimed object that is connected to some unclaimed objects, and if you change a property on the claimed object, propagation will not change the property value on the unclaimed objects. The items in the propagation scope are initially collected using the standard propagation rules. However, all unclaimed items are removed from the propagation scope before any property values are changed.

Items that are claimed for relationship are treated as unclaimed for the purpose of propagation.

**System Editing Command (Tools Menu)**

When System Editing is enabled for a plant, changed property values are automatically spread or propagated to related items according to the currently defined consistency criteria. In certain cases, you might want to set a property value on one item only and not allow it to be propagated to any related items.

The **System Editing** command (on the **Tools** menu and the toolbar) allows you to turn off the propagation https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

functionality temporarily during a design session. After the change has been made, you can use this same command to turn it back on again. System Editing is always turned on when you start a new design session.

System Editing can be enabled or disabled for the entire plant by means of the **Enable System Editing** setting that is exposed through Options Manager. For new plants, the value of this setting is True by default.

For upgraded plants, the value of this setting is False. This allows you to enable System Editing for an upgraded plant at the time of your choosing.

**Enable System Editing**

Select **Tools** > **System Editing** or select .

System Editing can be turned on or off for an entire plant for as long as needed or for a single design session.

**Creating and Applying Display Sets (PID)**

**Apply Display Set Command (View Menu)**

The display sets and filters created automatically function in the same way as the display sets and filters created manually.

For a display set that contains one or more asking filters, on selecting **Apply**, the **Asking Filters** dialog opens with the default values for each asking filter, allowing you to change the operators and values of each asking filter’s attributes, if desired. The attribute values you selected are used when saving or printing the drawing and those values are retained until the display set is cleared for that drawing. This applies on a per drawing basis; therefore if the same display set is applied to more than one drawing, you can enter different attribute values for each asking filter and those values are retained independently for each drawing.

**Display Set Legend**

Creates a legend for the filters in a display set when the **Legend Box** checkbox is selected in the **Apply** **Display Set** dialog, when applying a display set to a drawing. The legend includes the colors, names and descriptions of the filters in a defined format.

**Asking Filters Dialog**

Displays when you apply a display set that contains at least one asking filter to a drawing. For each asking filter in the display set, you can choose the operator and value of the filter’s attributes.

**Select filter to edit**

Displays all asking filters defined for the selected display set. Select a filter to display its details in the right pane.

**Filter details**

Displays the details of the selected asking filter. **Name**, **Item type**, **Match all** / **Match any**, and **Attributes** fields are read-only. You can change the **Operator** and **Value** for each attribute as desired.

**Updating Options Manager Settings**

You can force the software to regenerate the drawing by using the **Update Symbology** command. This command refreshes the graphic symbology of symbols in your drawing based on the current settings in Options Manager. The **ApplySettingsCmd** macro also updates the line settings, Minimum Connector Segment and Routing Self-Avoidance, so that the current values in Options Manager are reflected in the drawing.

The symbology and other settings defined in Options Manager usually take effect only in those drawings created after those values are defined. You can force changes in Options Manager to appear in the current drawing by updating Options Manager settings, regardless of when the drawing was created.

Any user can update drawings using these commands. However, check your permissions, which are assigned in Smart Engineering Manager, to find out if you can make changes to the plant-wide symbology in Options Manager.

After you load the current plant-wide definitions into your drawing, you cannot revert to previous definitions. However, you can always override plant-wide symbology choices in your drawing by using drawing filters and choosing alternate symbology for items.

**Update Symbology Command (Tools Menu)**

Updates the line width and color symbology for your active drawing. Redefining symbology in Options Manager usually affects only drawings created after the change. The **Update Symbology** command makes it possible to override this constraint.

**Update Symbology**

1. Open a drawing.
2. Select **Tools** > **Update Symbology**.

The line width and color symbology for your active drawing is changed to the most recent symbology defined in Options Manager. You do not have to update symbology for this drawing again, even if you end your design session, unless Options Manager symbology changes again.

Redefining symbology in Options Manager usually affects only drawings created after the change. The **Update Symbology** command makes it possible to override this constraint.

**Update Line Settings**

1. Select **Tools** > **Custom Commands** to display the **Custom Commands** dialog.
2. Double-click **ApplySettingsCmd.dll**. You can find this macro in the ..\SmartPlant\P&ID

Workstation\bin folder.

Two settings, **Minimum Connector Segment** and **Routing Self-Avoidance**, in Options Manager control the behavior of pipe and signal runs when placed in a drawing or when an inline component is placed on a run. You can change these settings in Options Manager, but the new values only affect lines placed after the change. The **ApplySettingsCmd.dll** macro applies the latest settings to all runs on the current drawing. You must run this macro for every drawing individually.

**Linking and Embedding Objects**

This software is compatible with Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) software. You can transfer text, numbers, or images between drawings or documents that were created with this software and other OLE

applications. You can move whole documents around or just parts of a document that you select. The information that you move is an object.

For example, you can use Microsoft Word to make a comment and then display the comment in your drawing, or you can insert a Microsoft Excel worksheet into a drawing. You can even create a drawing that contains another drawing, notes from Microsoft Word, and an Excel worksheet.

You can insert information created in another application with one of many methods: You can cut and paste an item to delete it from one location and move it to another location.

You can copy and paste an item to duplicate it in another location.

Linking stores data in one location and places a copy with a link in another location. When you change the original data, the copy can be updated either automatically or manually.

Embedding copies information and stores the information in another document that was created in a different application. If you change the embedded object, the original information does not change and vice versa.

**Linking or Embedding**

An object is data from one application that you insert in a drawing. You can link or embed information between drawings or documents that were created with this software and OLE software.

Linking stores data in one location and places a copy and a link in another location. The linked data is stored in the source document itself. When you paste the information in the destination document with the **Paste Link** option, a reference point or box is inserted into the destination document. This box displays the information that you pasted. When you change the original data, the pasted data is updated either automatically or manually. You can edit the linked information by opening the source document. You can insert linked information with the **Paste Special** command on the **Edit** menu. You can link an entire document to another document by inserting the information with the **Insert** > **Object** command on the **Edit** menu.

Embedding copies data in one document and stores the information in another document. If you change the copied data, the original information does not change, and vice versa. You can embed information with the **Paste Special** command on the **Edit** menu. You can embed an entire document inside another document by inserting the information with the **Insert** > **Object** command on the **Edit** menu.

If you want to keep the document size small, then link the data to another document. Linked information increases the document size only by the size of the displayed image, not by the size of the data itself.

Linking is also useful when you want to share information in many different places and set that information to update automatically. For example, if you want to display a drawing in several different reports that you created in Microsoft Word, you could link the drawing inside the documents that contained the reports.

Then, later, you could update the drawing by editing it in this software. Each report would automatically display the results of the drawing updates.

275/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

If document size is not an important factor, then use embedding. Embedded objects make the file size larger.

Embedding is useful when the person viewing the document with the embedded information does not have access to the software that created the object. The person can still view the information if it is embedded in the document. For example, if you wanted to send out several drawings for review, you could embed each drawing into a Microsoft Word document and send the Microsoft Word document to each reviewer.

Embedded information is also a good choice if the information does not need updating.

**Embedding by Cutting or Copying, and Pasting**

The easiest way to embed an object is to use the **Cut**, **Copy**, and **Paste** commands on the **Edit** menu in any OLE software. If you copy or paste information into an application in which you cannot edit the information, the software automatically embeds the information in the document. You can then edit the embedded information with the software that created it. If you cannot edit the information, the information appears as a static picture.

If you want to copy the information, and not remove it from its original location, press CTRL while dragging.

On the **Paste Special** dialog be sure that you select **Paste** and not **Paste Link**.

Or if you want to link the object, select **Paste Link** on the dialog.

**Linking or Embedding an Object**

If you want to insert an existing document, you can use **Edit** > **Insert** > **Object**, too. On the dialog, select the **Create from File** option and then enter the name, or browse to the document. The entire document is embedded into the drawing.

If you want to embed the existing object, make sure you have not selected **Link** on the dialog .

If you want to link the existing object, select **Link** on the dialog.

**Editing a Linked or Embedded Object**

To edit an object, you can double-click the object to open the software that created the object. If you do not have the source software installed, you cannot edit the object. The menus and toolbars of the current software are temporarily replaced by the menus and toolbars of the software that just opened.

Linked or embedded files are not transferred by Workshare. You must transfer those files manually, and they should be located in the same directory as the drawing files.

You can select commands on a shortcut menu to activate the software that created the object. To get the shortcut menu, right-click the embedded object.

You can type a URL with http syntax in the **Description** dialog to link World Wide Web documents to an item.

Symbols in drawings usually point to the catalog associated with the current plant. If items inadvertently point to the wrong catalog, you can correct this problem by using the **CheckFilePathsCmd** macro.

**Insert > Image Command (Edit Menu)**

Opens the **Insert Image** dialog, where you can insert an image into a drawing.

Inserted images are always linked to the source image file, therefore any changes made to the original image will be updated automatically in the drawing.

The following files types are supported:

.bmp

.gif

.jpg

.tif

**Insert an Image**

1. Select **Edit** > **Insert** > **Image**.
2. On the **Insert Image** dialog, browse to the folder and image file that you want to insert in your drawing.
3. Select **OK**.

*A box that is the size of the image appears at the end of the pointer so that you know where the image* *fits in the drawing.*

1. Move the pointer to the location in the drawing where you want to place your image and click to place it.

Inserted images are always linked to the source image file, therefore any changes made to the original image will be updated automatically in the drawing.

The following files types are supported:

.bmp

.gif

.jpg

.tif

**Insert > Object Command (Edit Menu)**

Opens the **Insert Object** dialog, where you can insert objects into a drawing with linking or embedding. The difference between linking and embedding is the method for storing and updating data.

When you link an object to a drawing, the drawing stores information about the location of the object, but the object itself is **not** stored in the drawing. When you embed an object in a drawing, the software stores a copy of the object in the drawing.

When you change a linked object, all drawings that have links to that object are updated. When you change an embedded object, the software updates only the copy of the object stored in the drawing.

The **Insert Object** command inserts any OLE-enabled object, such as a Microsoft Word file, .avi document, or CAD drawing, such as a .dwg drawing. You can edit an embedded object by double-clicking it. You can edit a linked object by selecting **Edit** > **Links** and selecting **Open Source**.

**Embed a New Object**

1. Select **Edit** > **Insert** > **Object**.
2. On the **Insert Object** dialog, select the **Create New** option. You can insert an object that already exists also. See Link or Embed a Previously Existing Object.
3. In **Object Type**, choose the software in which you want to create the object and then select **OK**. The contents of the list depend on the applications that are installed on your computer and that support linking and embedding. See Insert Object: File Types
4. After you create the object in its separate window, select **File** > **Exit** or **File** > **Update** in the source application. If a message appears asking if you want to update the document, select the **Yes** button.
5. Click the pointer, which now includes a box the size of the object at its end, at the location in the drawing where you want to insert the object.
6. If the software temporarily replaces some of the menus and toolbars, click anywhere outside the embedded object.

Do not use these procedures to create a symbol file. If you attempt to create a symbol source file, serious problems result in the drawing. Use Catalog Manager to create, change, or update symbols.

Linked or embedded files are not transferred by Workshare. You must transfer those files manually, and they should be located in the same directory as the drawing files.

After you embed a border file into a drawing template and a drawing is created in Drawing Manager using that template, any changes to the border file are not reflected in drawings created prior to the

change. See Create a Drawing Template.

You can move the embedded object again at any later time. See Move an Item with the Select Tool or

Move an Item Using the Move Button.

You can place an object on the Clipboard and then embed it by using **Edit** > **Paste Special**. See

Paste an Item with a Different Format.

With this procedure, you embed an entire document; you cannot embed a selection in a document.

If you insert a document into the drawing, the terminators, spaces, text, and styles appear in paper units relative to the source document. This behavior can cause the dimensions and text to appear very large or small in the drawing.

The software creates automatic links by default. An automatic update occurs when the drawing is opened: if a change is made to the source document and the drawing is already open, the change does not appear in the drawing until it is closed and re-opened. The software updates manual links only at the time that you indicate. To change the way the software updates links, select **Edit** > **Links** and specify automatic or manual update mode for each link.

In the **Description** box in the **Properties** window, you can type an URL with http syntax to link documents to an Internet item. Select the ellipsis to open the **Description** dialog.

**Link or Embed a Previously Existing Object**

1. Select **Edit** > **Insert** > **Object**.
2. On the **Insert Object** dialog, select **Create From File**.
3. In the **File** box, type the name and directory path of the document that you want to include in your drawing, or select **Browse** to find and choose the file.
4. If you want to link this object to your drawing, select the **Link** box. If you want to embed the object, do not select this option.
5. Select **OK**.

You can embed an OLE object, such as a Microsoft Word document or Microsoft Excel workbook, by dragging the file from Windows into a drawing, too. With this procedure, you can create a link only to an entire document; you cannot link to a selection in a document.

You can link an OLE by dragging a document from the Windows environment onto the drawing also.

You must press the CTRL + SHIFT keys while dragging to link the information. If you do not press these keys, the information is embedded.

OLE objects are enclosed by a SmartFrame with a border. If you are saving a drawing to AutoCAD

frame. Or, you can crop the object by pressing the SHIFT key and dragging one of the handles.

Info Tab (SmartFrame Properties Dialog)

Border Tab (SmartFrame Properties Dialog)

User Tab (SmartFrame Properties Dialog Box)

**Info Tab (SmartFrame Properties Dialog)**

Provides information about frames around objects, such as raster images or drawings from other applications.

**Type**

Displays the category of the selected element. You cannot edit this value.

**Sheet**

Displays the name of the drawing sheet that contains the selected element. You cannot edit this value.

**Name**

Allows you to type a name for the SmartFrame.

**Layer**

Sets the layer that contains the selected element.

**Origin**

Specifies the coordinates, or location, of an element along the X and Y-axes.

**Behavior**

Specifies how the SmartFrame reacts to changes made within its source. For example, if **Fit Reference to** **Frame** is selected and the size of the frame contents is expanded, the SmartFrame will also resize and attempt to encompass all the data. Conversely, if you resize the SmartFrame, the data inside is scaled so that it continues to fit within the frame. If **Frame Fixed** is selected, the SmartFrame does not react to changes made within its source, and resizing the frame will not affect the scale factor of the frame contents; consequently, the frame remains “fixed” in its original size and position.

**Height**

Displays the height of the selected SmartFrame. The value in this field is for display purposes only.

**Width**

Displays the width of the selected SmartFrame. The value in this field is for display purposes only.

**Scale**

Allows you to specify the SmartFrame scaling options:

**Scale (1:1)**

Sets the drawing scale to a 1:1 ratio. This means that the representation of the objects on the drawing sheet is the same size as the real-world object being described.

**Select scale**

Sets the drawing scale to a standard ratio. The specified ratio defines the size of the drawing in relation to the size of the real-world object. For a 2:1 ratio, the “2” represents the size of the drawing and the “1”

represents the size of the real-world object.

**Custom**

Defines a custom or scale ratio. The first value defines the distance on the drawing sheet and the second value defines this distance in a real-world value.

**Use photographic style scale**

Controls how paper-based items are scaled. When this option is enabled (and if the **Display as printed** option on the **View Tab** of the **Options** dialog is also enabled), text and geometry widths scale up. When this option is disabled, text and geometry widths stay true to size (even if **Display as printed** is enabled).

**Link**

Determines the way that the object links with a **SmartFrame**. This option is available only for linked objects.

**As part of the model (public)**

Allows the linked object to publicly appear in any document that links to the current document. Therefore, if you link an object to the current drawing and then link to the current drawing from another document, the current drawing and the linked object appear in the other document. For example, this setting is useful if you link comments from a Word document to the current drawing and you want other documents to appear in the current drawing with the comments.

**As reference only (private)**

Restricts the linked object from being displayed in any document that links to the current document. If the current drawing is linked to another document, the linked object does not appear in the other document. For example, this setting could be useful if you want to link comments from a Word document to the current drawing and you want other documents to display the drawing, but not the comments.

**Border Tab (SmartFrame Properties Dialog)**

Allows you to format frames around objects, such as raster images or drawings from other applications.

**Show border**

Turns on/off the frame border around the object. This option only affects the border display in Smart P&ID. If you are saving a drawing to AutoCAD and you want to hide the border in the exported drawing, you must assign a value of **0** to the pidacad.dwg seed file **FRAME** variable. See under **Notes** in Save a Drawing in a

Different Format).

**Color**

Sets the color of the border.

**Line Width**

Sets the line width.

**Line Type**

Overrides a line type for a drawing sheet or embedded object and sets another line style for an element or linked object.

**View shape**

Specifies the geometric shape of the border. Two options are available: **Rectangular** and **Elliptical**.

Changing the border shape can result in cropping the contents of the SmartFrame.

**User Tab (SmartFrame Properties Dialog Box)**

**Attribute set**

Names a group of attributes. You can type a name in the box and press TAB.

**Save**

Places the attribute set on the element that you selected.

**Remove**

Removes the attribute set from the element that you selected.

**Attributes**

Sets the name, type, and value of the attribute set. You can type a name in the box and press TAB.

**Name**

Sets the name of a unique attribute in the attribute set.

**Type**

Sets the type for the attribute, such as double, text, number, money, or date.

**Value**

Sets the value for the attribute. The value that you can type is based on the value in the **Type** box.

**Add**

Adds an attribute to the attribute set. After you select **Add**, the attribute appears in the table.

**Delete**

Removes an attribute from the attribute set. You can select an attribute by selecting a row in the table.

**Working with Assemblies**

An assembly is a group of items that you can place in a drawing at one time. Assemblies can save time because you do not have to keep creating commonly-occurring groups of items. Instead of copying and pasting each individual item into a drawing at several locations, you can place the group of items: the assembly. An example of an assembly is a control valve with vents on both sides, an instrument loop that controls the valve, and a piping bypass around the valve.

You can create an assembly by selecting several items in a drawing and saving as an assembly. The file extension for an assembly is .pid, which is the same file extension as a drawing. If you want to retrieve the assembly from the **Catalog Explorer** tree view, you must save the assembly where the other symbols are located. The **Save as Assembly** command prompts you to save the assembly in the correct directory, which is specified in Options Manager.

Placing assemblies is like placing any other item from **Catalog Explorer** into a drawing. When you want to place an assembly into a drawing, you select the assembly from **Catalog Explorer** and select a location in the drawing. Or, you can drag the assembly into the drawing. The information in each label remains intact when you place the assembly. After you have placed an assembly, the items in the assembly are treated as separate items. You can delete just one item without concern that the software deletes the entire assembly.

Assemblies cannot be placed inline. You must place the assembly first and then route piping to it, if required.

Assemblies can be created in one plant and used in another. However, the file structure and symbols must be identical. If you try to place an assembly into a plant that uses a different file structure, you get an error message that the software cannot find your reference files. The assembly placement quits.

Move the symbols that cannot be found to the location indicated in the error message.

When creating or placing assemblies, a log file is created for each action. The log files are placed in the Temp directory and are named _CreAsm.log and _PlaAsm.log.

The following is an example of the log file created when creating assemblies.

**Save as Assembly Command (File Menu)**

Saves selected items as an assembly. This command is available only when items are selected in the drawing. Assemblies are saved with the .pid file extension. A red target appears at the end of your pointer.

You use this target to specify the origin of the assembly for placement. You can only use a standalone symbol as the origin of an assembly. For example, you cannot use labels, pipe runs, signal runs, or child items; however, you can use unattached ends of pipe runs. The **Save Assembly** dialog opens after you specify the origin, and you can name the assembly and place it in the proper directory.

The **Save As Assembly** command does not constitute an undoable action; therefore, it does not appear as a step available for the **Undo** command.

**Create an Assembly**

1. Select several components in the drawing. You can select more than one item at a time by dragging the pointer to fence objects. To remove an item from the selection, select it while pressing CTRL.
2. Select **File** > **Save as Assembly**.
3. Use the red target that appears at the end of your pointer to specify the origin of the assembly for placement.

You can only use a standalone symbol as the origin of an assembly. For example, you cannot use labels, pipe runs, signal runs, or child items; however, you can use unattached ends of pipe runs.

Any graphics that have been band-aided should be deleted and replaced prior to using this command.

The file extension for assemblies is .pid.

You can save an assembly in any directory that you want, but the default assembly path is specified in Options Manager. If you use the default folder, then you can retrieve the assembly from **Catalog** **Explorer**. In order to save assemblies, you must have write permissions to the folder defined in Options Manager.

Assemblies can be created in one plant and used in another. However, the file structure and symbols must be identical. If you try to place an assembly into a plant that uses a different file structure, you get an error message that the software cannot find your reference files. The assembly placement quits. Move the symbols that cannot be found to the location indicated in the error message.

**Place an Assembly**

1. In the **Catalog Explorer** list view, select the assembly that you want to place.
2. Use the red target that appears at the end of your pointer to position the assembly appropriately. The red target is the origin of the assembly. Some assembly members also appear during placement to aid you. To quit placement mode, press ESC, or you can escape placement mode by right-clicking.
3. Connect the pipe runs and instruments on either side of the assembly. You cannot place an assembly into a line that is already routed.
4. Modify or delete individual components in the assembly as necessary.

Assemblies are stored in a specific folder, **Assemblies**, in the **Catalog Explorer** tree view.

**Creating D&IDs in Smart P&ID**

Smart P&ID allows you to create Ducting and Instrumentation Diagrams (D&IDs). You can place components such as rooms, equipment, ducting, piping, and instrumentation from Catalog Explorer or the stockpile in a D&ID.

The following item types are intended for use with D&IDs:

Duct runs

Duct nozzles

Ducting components

Ducting points

Rooms

Room components

The following D&ID reports are available:

Duct Component MTO

Duct Run List

Room List

**Placing and Manipulating Rooms and Room Components**

**Placing Rooms**

You can place rooms in drawings for use with ducting or piping. If required, you can place a room as a multiple representation in several drawings. After placing a room you can: Attach a duct run or pipe run to a room via a nozzle

Associate a room with instruments or with equipment such as towers, boilers, heat exchangers, and reactors

Place room components

**Placing Room Components**

As you place room components, the software automatically creates a group relationship between the room and the component. As a group, the components move when you move the room. However, you can only associate a room component with a single room. When you place a room component, the component is associated with the last selected or highlighted room, creating a group.

Depending on the rules defined for the room or room component, you can define limits for the possible placements for the room. For example, a particular component can be specified for placement inside the room only, while a different component can be specified for placement outside the room only. Rule Manager defines rules that determine the way that model items interact during manipulation.

The software includes a standard group of room and room component symbols; however, you or your plant administrator can change and add to these symbols as needed for your plant.

**Associate a Room with a Plant Item**

1. Select the equipment item or instrument with which you want to associate a room.
2. In the **Properties** window or in the **Engineering Data Editor**, beside the **Room Tag** property, select the ellipsis button . In the **Properties** window, you can select the room tag directly by selecting the drop-down list icon and selecting the desired room.
3. On the **Find Room Tag** dialog, type a string corresponding to all or part of the room tag in the **Search** **string** box. You can use the percent character, %, as a wildcard. To display all available room tags, type **%**.
4. Select **Find** to display the list of room tags corresponding to the search string you entered.
5. In the **Results** window, select the room tag of the room that you want to associate with the plant item.

In general, it is only possible to associate a room with a plant item that is in the same drawing as the room or is in that drawing’s stockpile. To enable association of a room with a plant item in another

drawing, you must place a multiple representation of the room in the target drawing. See Place

Multiple Representations.

Property validation is triggered when any property that comprises the room Item Tag value is added or modified: Tag Prefix, Tag Sequence Number, or Tag Suffix. The room Item Tag format is: (Tag Prefix)-

(Tag Sequence Number)(Tag Suffix).

The Room Tag of a plant item associated with a room comprises the same properties as the room Item Tag, and has the same format: (Tag Prefix)-(Tag Sequence Number)(Tag Suffix). When any property that comprises the Room Tag is added or modified, validation automatically creates a Room Tag designated for the drawing.

Room components and nozzles are automatically associated with the room they are attached to.

**Find Room Tag Dialog**

This dialog allows you to search for and specify the room tag for the item whose properties currently appear in the **Properties** window or in the **Engineering Data Editor**. This dialog opens when you select the ellipsis button beside the **Room Tag** property.

Displays the room tags that meet the criteria in the **Search string** box. You can choose a tag in this window and select **OK** to assign the tag to the item whose properties currently appear in the **Properties** window or in the **Engineering Data Editor**.

**Equivalent Diameter and Cross Section Area Properties**

These properties apply to duct runs, ducting components, as well as to inline instruments and nozzles with ducting points. The properties are calculated as follows:

Equivalent Diameter = 1.3 * (Duct Height * Duct Width)^0.625 / (Duct Height + Duct Width)^0.25

Cross Section Area = (Duct Height * Duct Width)

The Equivalent Diameter and Cross Section Area properties are read-only.

**Using Projects in an Existing Workshare Collaboration**

You must discontinue all Workshare collaboration in a plant before you can create projects in the plant. In other words, if the plant structure contains active **Satellites**, the **Enable Projects** command remains unavailable. We recommend completing the following tasks before enabling the plant for projects.

1. Transfer all drawings to the host.
2. Delete all satellites.
3. Disable the plant for Workshare.
4. Enable the plant for projects.

1. Create a project to serve as the host.
2. Enable the project for Workshare.
3. Create satellite slots in the project host.
4. Create satellites.
5. Check out or fetch drawings at the host, then re-distribute drawings back out to the satellites.

**Working with Off-Site Projects**

To implement off-site projects in Smart P&ID, you use standalone workshare functionality. See the following help topics:

**Working with Smart P&ID Projects**

Plants, after designed and built, are often modified throughout their lifecycles. During these modifications, information assets of the “As-Built” state must be maintained. Using projects in your plant allows you to maintain this information while allowing multiple projects, possibly overlapping and running concurrently, to be designed, approved, constructed, and/or canceled.

Before creating a project in a plant, you must enable that plant for projects. When enabled for projects, the plant structure becomes the Plant, sometimes referred to as the Master or As-Built plant. In a Task/Master scenario, the Plant is the Master and the projects are the individual Tasks.

**Database Configuration**

To allow work on projects to proceed without affecting the Plant, separate schemas are created for each project. In other words, all projects must be located in the same database instance as the Plant, with each project contained within a separate schema (separate database user names).

297/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The Plant shares reference data with its projects. Changes to the reference data can be made only in the Plant. In other words, you can use Catalog Manager, Data Dictionary Manager, Filter Manager, and Format Manager in a project, but you have read-only permissions and are not allowed to modify any of the data from within these managers.

**Fetching and Checking Out Drawings**

After projects are enabled in Smart Engineering Manager, the As-Built can no longer create drawings; drawings are created inside projects. However, any drawings that might have existed in the plant before projects were enabled remain in the As-Built. All drawing versions in the As-Built are read-only drawings when projects are enabled, but these drawings can still be deleted in the As-Built, unless the drawing is either fetched or checked out to a project. If the plant is registered in SmartPlant Foundation, drawings can be created and edited in the As-Built, except for drawings that are checked out to a project.

**Projects and Claiming**

One of the main capabilities associated with using projects in an integrated environment is the ability for a project to *claim* a drawing object. When a project claims an object, the project controls modifications to that object. A project cannot modify objects it has not claimed. All the modifications and claiming of objects is carried out in the design software, but the claim states of objects inside drawings do have ramifications for drawing manipulation and for completing projects. You do not need to check out a drawing to claim items on it; you can claim items on a fetched drawing.

Projects claim objects in either Exclusive (default) or Shared mode. If you plan to use the project in an integrated environment, Exclusive mode is mandatory. Use the **Settings** view in Options Manager to set the Claim Mode before creating a project.

When publishing from a project, an instruction container, which contains all the claimed objects, is created within the tombstone file.

You can change the Claim Mode to Shared at any time. However, you can change the mode to Exclusive only when there are no claims in any project in the Plant.

**Using Workshare with Projects**

Workshare functions the same whether using projects or not. The only difference is that when using projects, only a project can function as a Workshare host. The Plant cannot be a host or a satellite when projects are enabled.

**Working with Drawings within a Project**

After enabling and creating projects in Smart Engineering Manager for Smart P&ID, use Drawing Manager to manipulate the drawings. Actual design work is still accomplished in Smart P&ID; however, managing and https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

setting out that work is largely controlled from the Drawing Manager interface. Only the project can use the commands on the **Project** menu in Drawing Manager to fetch, check in, and check out drawings.

After projects are enabled in Smart Engineering Manager, the As-Built can no longer create drawings; drawings are created inside projects. However, any drawings that might have existed in the plant before projects were enabled remain in the As-Built. All drawing versions in the As-Built are read-only drawings when projects are enabled, but these drawings can still be deleted in the As-Built, unless the drawing is either fetched or checked out to a project. If the plant is registered in SmartPlant Foundation, drawings can be created and edited in the As-Built, except for drawings that are checked out to a project.

When you are using projects inside Smart P&ID, remember that the reference data belongs to the Plant and is used by projects of the As-Built. You cannot change reference data, such as table layouts or formats or rules, at the project level.

**Claiming**

Claiming Items on a drawing is one of the main features of using projects in an integrated environment.

When a project claims an object on a drawing, the project controls modifications to that object. A project cannot modify objects that it has not claimed.

Projects claim objects in either Exclusive (default) or Shared claim mode. If you plan to use the project in an integrated environment, Exclusive mode is mandatory. Use the **Settings** view in Options Manager to set the **Claim Mode** value before creating a project.

You can change the claim mode to Shared at any time. However, you can change the claim mode to Exclusive only when there are no claims in any project in the Plant.

All the modifications and claiming of objects is carried out in the design software, but the claim states of objects inside drawings do have ramifications for drawing manipulation and for completing projects. You do not need to check out a drawing to claim items on it; you can claim items on a fetched drawing.

**Smart P&ID Project Statuses**

You can review the status of the active project using the **Project Status** command in Drawing Manager. The **Project Status** dialog shows the status of the active project and tells you where the project is in its lifecycle.

See Modify Project Status in Smart P&ID.

A **project** status shows the stage of the project life-cycle. Possible project statuses are: **Active**

The initial state of a project right after its creation.

**Completed**

Indicates that all the work on the project items has been completed and that the items are ready to be merged back into the As-Built. You cannot claim items in a project whose status has been set to **Completed** https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

or **Merged**.

In a project, when searching for completed items in the **Project Management** window, it is possible to select the related items which have not been completed yet and to change their status to **Completed**.

**Merged**

Indicates that all the project items have been merged back into the As-Built.

**Canceled**

Indicates that the project has been canceled and it can be deleted. Selecting this project status changes the status of the items in the project from **Claimed** to **Scoped**.

**Project Status Command (Project Menu)**

Opens the **Project Status** dialog, which allows you to update, modify, and verify the status of your project with respect to the Plant and/or SmartPlant Foundation. Possible statuses include **Active**, **Completed**, **Merged**, and **Canceled**. This command is not available if you are currently in the Plant; it is only available if your current database is a project database.

After a project enters the **Completed** state, all the commands are disabled and design work is no longer possible within that project. If you later determine that the project is really not done, use the **Return to** **Active** button on the **Project Status** dialog. This command resets the project status to **Active**, allowing work to continue in the project. This command is only enabled when the project is in the **Completed** state.

**Project Status Dialog**

Displays the current project status, both with respect to SmartPlant Foundation and the plant and allows you to update or modify those statuses. This dialog opens when you select **Project** > **Project Status** on the main menu bar.

**Fetching a Drawing to an Active Project**

Fetching a drawing from the Plant places a copy of the drawing in the project. Only one project at a time can check out a drawing, but numerous projects can *fetch* the same drawing.

Fetched drawings can have read-only or read/write permissions. If you want to save changes to a read/write fetched drawing into the Plant, you must check the drawing out first, apply your changes, and then check it back into the Plant.

If you are working with projects but are not connected to SmartPlant Foundation, all claims on items in that drawing are automatically released when you delete a fetched drawing from your project database.

A Workshare satellite can only fetch drawing versions from its own database by using the **Fetch** command in the **Version History** dialog. If you want a drawing version from another project or the Plant, it must be fetched into the host project and then the satellite can use the **Get Latest Version** commands on the **Workshare** menu.

**Fetch Command (Project Menu)**

Displays the **Fetch** dialog, which provides options for fetching a drawing version from the Plant or another project. You can fetch a drawing with read/write permissions or with read-only permissions.

The **Fetch** command is not available if you are currently working in the Plant. You cannot fetch a deleted drawing, but a deleted drawing can be retrieved if a version of it is saved, and then you can fetch it.

**Fetch Dialog**

Displays the active Plant hierarchy and lists its drawings, allowing you to fetch a drawing from a specified database. This dialog appears when you select **Project** > **Fetch** or the **Fetch**  command.

You can open a read-only version of the drawing for review by selecting **View**. For more information about viewing drawing versions without fetching or checking them out, see Show the Version History of a Drawing.

If you are connected to SmartPlant Foundation and you have already fetched the drawing with read/write permissions when you check the drawing out, the fetched version remains intact and only its status changes to checked-out. That is, you cannot replace the fetched version with the version in the Plant.

**Checking a Drawing Out to an Active Project**

Checking out a drawing places that drawing under the control of the project. No other project can check out the same drawing while your project has it checked out. The advantage of checking out rather than fetching a drawing is that only checked out drawings can have their changes reflected back in the Plant.

The software notifies you if you try to fetch a version of a drawing that you have already checked out.

When working with projects in an integrated environment, you must select **No** for the **Enable**

**“Keep Checked Out” on Check-In** option in Options Manager.

After you check out a drawing to a project, the drawing will be read only in the As-Built and the following actions are not allowed:

Modifying drawing properties

Modifying the drawing or any drawing items or properties

Deleting the drawing

Updating the drawing using Drawing Manager

Updating the drawing using automation

You cannot check out a drawing to a project if it is open in the As-Built.

The software cannot validate a drawing in the As-Built using the Global Validation functionality if you have checked out that drawing to a project.

**Check Out Command (Project Menu)**

Displays the **Check Out** dialog, allowing you to check drawings out from the Plant and into your current project. This command checks user permissions, assigned in Smart Engineering Manager, before it allows you to check out a drawing.

You can check out drawings that you have already fetched to your project, too. The **Check Out** command is available only inside a project of the Plant; that is, you cannot check a drawing out from a project and into the Plant. After a drawing is checked out to a project, the drawing icon changes to reflect the new status.

**Drawings**

Lists the drawings that are being checked out, and shows the status of that operation.

**View Log**

Opens the log file, CheckOut.log, which is created when you check out a drawing version.

**Undo Checkout Command (Project Menu)**

Opens the **Undo Checkout** dialog, which enables you to return the drawing to the status of not being checked out without going through the process of checking the drawing in. This command is available only when you are working in the project that has the drawing in question checked out. You must select the checked-out drawing in the **List** view in order to use this command.

If you do not choose to remove the drawing from the project when you undo the checkout, the drawing remains in the project as a fetched drawing with read/write permissions.

If the project has claimed items on the checked-out drawing, then selecting **Undo Checkout** and using the **Remove from project** option, the software reminds you to release all claims prior to undoing the check out.

**Undo a Drawing Checkout**

1. In the **List** view in the project, select the checked-out drawing that you want to return to the Plant.
2. Select **Project** > **Undo Checkout**.
3. On the **Undo Checkout** dialog, choose an option for either retaining or completely removing the drawing from the project database.

**Undo Checkout Dialog**

Allows you to return the selected drawing to the Plant without going through the process of checking the drawing in. With the options on this dialog, you can choose to leave a fetched version of the checked-out drawing in the active project or to delete the drawing from the project database altogether. This dialog opens when you select **Project** > **Undo Checkout** on the main menu bar.

**Remove from project**

Returns the drawing to the Plant and deletes it from the project. If the project has claimed items on the checked-out drawing, you must release all claimed items before you can undo checkout.

**Leave in project**

Returns the drawing to the Plant while leaving a fetched drawing with read/write permissions in the project.

**Compare Drawing Versions for As-Built and Projects**

1. In the **List** view, select the drawing.
2. Select **Version History** .
3. In the drawing list on the **Version History** dialog, select the version in the active project that you want to compare against a version elsewhere.
4. Select **Compare With**.
5. On the **Compare With** dialog, select the correct target project or the Plant database from the **Available Databases** list.
6. In the **History** list, choose the version of the drawing that you want to compare against your version and select **OK**.
7. On the **Compare** dialog, you can view the differences between the two versions, but you cannot make changes to the designs. To change the design, you must use Smart P&ID. For more information about using the compare-and-refresh capabilities inside Smart P&ID, see Comparing and Refreshing

Versions in *Smart P&ID Help*.

You can manipulate the views and navigate through the listed changes by using the commands on the **Compare** dialog toolbar. Each **Drawing** view also has its own shortcut menu, which includes manipulation https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

commands that apply only to that view.

You can select an item in either **Drawing** view. The item is then located in the appropriate group in the **Change details** list. If you select an item in the **Change details** list, then you can use the **Find in** **Drawings** button on the toolbar to locate the item in one or both **Drawing** views.

You can select an item in the **Drawing** view or in the **Change details** list. Properties for that item appear in the **Properties** window. Selecting multiple items is not possible on the **Compare** dialog.

The following differences are ignored: claim status, select list strings, linked or embedded objects, symbology, and inconsistency indicators.

You can only compare a drawing against a version of itself; that is, you cannot compare one drawing to another drawing.

You can also compare versions when you are checking in a drawing. See Check In a Drawing.

If you attempt to compare two versions that are actually identical to each other, the **Compare** dialog does not open and a confirmation message alerts you as to why.

**Returning a Drawing to the Plant Using Check In**

Checking in a drawing writes all of the changes made to the drawing by the project into the drawing stored in the Plant. When a drawing is checked in, all versions of that drawing are deleted from the project.

**Verification Processes Performed During Check In**

All objects that exist in the project but don’t exist in the Plant must be claimed.

All objects that exist in the Plant but don’t exist in the project (they were deleted) must have been claimed.

All objects that exist in both the Plant and the project must be identical if not claimed.

The claim state must be valid for the project.

If any claim on an object on this drawing is invalid, then check in cannot occur.

The timestamp on all objects that exist in the project must be earlier than or equal to the timestamp on the drawing.

Last Publish Date > Drawing date.

Check in is not allowed if drawing is in a **Re-create** state.

The **Verify for Checkin** command for new drawings should ensure that all items on the drawing have been claimed.

If an invalid claim is found but the item in question matches the item in the Plant, run **Verify for** **Checkin** to resolve this situation. This process automatically sets the claim to valid and allows the check in to occur.

**Check In Command (Project Menu)**

Enables you to check drawings into the Plant. This command is available only when drawings are selected in the **List** view and when those drawings are checked out to the current project. Drawings created in a project automatically belong to that project and can be selected and checked in. This command is not available from within the Plant.

You must have the correct permissions, assigned in Smart Engineering Manager, to check drawings in or out.

You cannot check a drawing in if any of the objects that belong to that drawing were modified after the latest version of a drawing was created. For more information about creating versions, see Save a Version of a Drawing.

When you check a drawing into the Plant, any claims on objects on that drawing are automatically released. See Claiming Items.

When you check a drawing into the Plant, your version of the drawing becomes the current version in the Plant. However, the version that was in the Plant already is automatically saved as the previous version.

You can select a checked out drawing and use the **Verify for Checkin** command to make sure claims

and conflicts are resolved before you try to check in a drawing. See Verify a Drawing for Checkin.

4. On the **Verifying Drawings for Checkin** dialog, observe the progress of the verification operations.

Select **View Log** if you want to examine notes on the operation.

After verifying the drawing for checkin, check the drawing into the Plant as soon as possible because the verification process does not freeze the drawing state and the changes can be made to the

drawing during any interim time between verification and actual check in. See Check In a Drawing.

You cannot check in a fetched drawing, it must be checked out first. You can, however, check in a new drawing created in the project. See Check Out a Drawing.

Verifying a drawing for checkin checks exactly the same drawing conditions as the **Check In** command, but without actually checking the drawing into the Plant.

If an invalid claim is found but the item in question matches the item in the Plant, run **Verify for** **Checkin** to resolve this situation. This process automatically sets the claim to valid and allows the check in to occur.

**Verification Processes Performed During Check In**

All objects that exist in the project but don’t exist in the Plant must be claimed.

All objects that exist in the Plant but don’t exist in the project (that is, they were deleted) must have been claimed.

All objects that exist in both the Plant and the project must be identical if not claimed.

The claim state must be valid for the project.

If any claim on an object on this drawing is invalid then check in cannot occur.

The timestamp on all objects that exist in the project must be earlier than or equal to the timestamp on the drawing.

**Editing Drawing Items Within a Project**

New items can be created in a project drawing using Smart P&ID. As these items are added to the drawing, they are automatically claimed by the project. If your edits to an item cause related items to be modified, those related items must be claimed also. Moving items and adding labels, for example, can be accomplished without claiming.

When an existing drawing is fetched or checked out to a project, none of the items are claimed. You will not be able to modify or delete any items until they are claimed. Use the **Claim** command to define the scope for your project. Claim modes include Exclusive and Shared. Exclusive mode allows only a single project to claim an item. Using Shared mode, multiple projects can claim the same item at the same time.

You can compare your current drawing with a previous version to locate any differences. These differences display as change groups. The change group contains a list of changes that can be made in the current drawing and still maintain consistency. You can then choose to accept the changes, if needed. Each change group is marked if it affects items you have claimed. You should accept, or refresh, all of the changes that do not involve items claimed by you because these items represent changes checked in by other projects.

See Comparing and Refreshing Versions

Items must be claimed before you can delete them. If deleting an item results in changes to related items, then those related items must be claimed also.

**Claiming Items**

A project in the Plant frequently deals with a subset of items within a drawing. The Claim functionality provided by Smart P&ID allows you to grant control of an item to a project. Because claiming makes it possible for a project to work on an item-by-item basis, claiming fosters an ability to define the scope of work as narrowly as necessary.

A new item is created in a project in the same ways it can be created in a greenfield plant (not applicable for Smart P&ID Engineering). The simplest way to create a new item is to drag a catalog item from the Catalog Explorer** **and drop it onto a drawing. A new item in a drawing is automatically claimed to the project.

However, when an existing drawing is fetched or checked out to a project, none of the items on that drawing are initially claimed. Before you can modify any of those items, you must claim them.

After you have claimed an item, you can modify it using the same methods that you would use in a plant that is not project enabled. Purely graphical modifications to drawing items are allowed without claiming those items (not applicable for Smart P&ID Engineering). For example, a symbol can be repositioned or the vertices of a connector can be moved. Also, labels can be added or removed without claiming anything.

Any modification that changes the meaning of the schematic design (not applicable for Smart P&ID

Engineering), however, requires that the affected items be claimed. For example, if you break a pipe run, some of the piping components and inline instruments in that pipe run will be reassigned to the new pipe run. Therefore, the pipe run, the piping components and the instruments in that pipe run must all be claimed before you break it. If they are not claimed, an error message will be displayed.

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Properties of items that are not claimed by the active project cannot be changed. In the Smart P&ID

modeler, the mirror and rotate handles are not available for any item you select that was not claimed by your project. The **Properties** window and the **Engineering Data Editor** do not allow editing of properties on items that are not claimed: the properties are read-only as if the drawing is in a read-only state. No other explicit prompts let you know that you cannot edit an item that you have not claimed. However, you can manipulate the **Drawing** view properties so that the claim state of items is visually apparent.

System Editing does not allow property values to flow to unclaimed objects. If you have a claimed object that is connected to some unclaimed objects, and if you change a property on the claimed object, propagation will not change the property value on the unclaimed objects. The items in the propagation scope are initially collected using the standard propagation rules. However, all unclaimed items are removed from the propagation scope before any property values are changed.

Items that are claimed for relationship are treated as unclaimed for the purpose of propagation.

You cannot delete items that have not been claimed (not applicable for Smart P&ID Engineering). After you have claimed an item, you can delete it using the same methods that you would use in a greenfield plant.

However, if the deletion of an item would result in related items being deleted or modified, then those related items must also be claimed. For example, if you delete a vessel, the nozzles attached to it will be deleted and the pipe runs connected to the nozzles will be modified. Therefore, the vessel, the nozzles and the pipe runs must all be claimed before you delete the vessel. If they are not claimed, an error message will be displayed.

You do not need to check out a drawing to claim objects; you can fetch a drawing with read/write permissions and claim its objects. Claim commands appear on shortcut menus in the **Drawing** view, in the **Engineering Data Editor**, and on the **Edit** menu.

**Releasing Claims**

From inside a project, you can invoke a claim at any time to expand the scope of your project, and any new item created in a project is automatically claimed by that project. You can also release a claim at any time, but you cannot release the claim that is automatically created when your project creates a new item.

Claims are automatically released on all drawing items when that drawing is checked into the Plant; however, a drawing cannot be checked in if any objects that are *not* claimed differ from the Plant.

**Claim Mode**

The claim mode can be set to either **Exclusive** or **Shared** by using the **Settings** option in Smart P&ID

Options Manager. The claim mode controls how items are claimed by concurrent projects.

If the claim mode is set to **Exclusive**, only one project can claim an item at any given time. Exclusive mode enforces the rule that concurrent projects do not overlap at the object level. With this setting, conflict resolution at check in time is simplified.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

323/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

If the claim mode is set to **Shared**, a single item can be claimed to more than one project. Shared mode allows concurrent projects to overlap at the object level. This setting might be required for plants that have overlapping projects. Conflict resolution at check in time will be more complex.

**Invalid Claims**

When an item is claimed by a project, it must be consistent with the state of the item in the Plant. Otherwise, an invalid claim exists. Invalid claiming can happen only for Plants that support shared claiming of database items. Invalidly claimed items differ from the Plant items in that you cannot check in a drawing to the Plant without first establishing a valid claim on items that have been modified.

When the Plant uses Shared claim mode and a project checks in a drawing, the claims made by other projects to objects on that same drawing are now invalid if the project that checked in the drawing also changed an item claimed by a different project.

You can determine the validity of a claim by using the **Claim Status** command.

If an invalid claim is found but the item in question matches the item in the Plant, run **Verify for Check In** to resolve the situation. This process automatically sets the claim to valid and allows the check in to occur.

**Partial Claim**

When a claimed item has a relationship with another item that has not been claimed, any change made to the claimed item that also changes the relationship, causes the non-claimed item to receive Partial Claim status, denoted by . Partial Claim status only applies to objects connected to pipe runs (inline components such as instrumentation and piping components).

Partial claim works automatically when a claimed pipe run is ‘broken’. There is a routine that determines which side of the broken pipe run gets the new GUID and which side maintains the original GUID. Inline components on the side that gets the new GUID receive Partial Claim status, which is only for the purpose of changing their database relationship to the pipe run with new GUID. Data cannot be edited on items that are ‘claimed for relationship purposes’.

A list of claimed items is automatically published to SmartPlant.

Claim commands are not available when you open a fetched drawing with read-only permissions.

Claiming of labels is ignored.

Drawing Manager is the only tool for checking in, checking out, and fetching drawings.

You must have full control user access permissions for P&ID objects before you can claim objects.

See *Smart Engineering Manager*  Help.

Objects are claimed by the *project*, not by a single user. After a project claims an item, it can be modified by anyone with the appropriate permissions in that project.

In Exclusive claim mode, the software allows the user to claim all the selected items that were not already claimed by other projects. The claim log shows which items could not be claimed because they were already claimed by other projects.

Claiming items clears the Undo stack. Thus, claiming is not a command that can be undone.

**Claim Command**

Gives control of the selected items to the current active project. The Claim Dialog opens, allowing you to confirm the “claim-ability” of the items and enter claim comments. Claim comments can be viewed later by anyone in the Plant when the claim status is displayed.

This command can only be used for items that belong to the active drawing.

**Claim Dialog**

Opens when you select an item and select **Edit** > Claim on the main menu bar and displays details of the items that you select for claiming. You can discover if the selected items are already claimed by your project or another project. The **Claim** command checks first if your project already has a valid claim on a selected item. Next it checks if the items are claimed by another project, and if the Plant uses exclusive sharing, this step can produce an error display on the **Claim** dialog. Finally the command compares the selected items against the same items in the Plant and displays a warning if an object either differs from that item in the Plant or if the object does not exist in the Plant.

**Items to be claimed**

Lists the items that are selected in the Drawing view or **Engineering Data Editor** and their details. These are the items that you claim to your project when you select **OK**. You can select multiple elements of this list and record comments for this claim operation. In this list, you can also see if a selected item is already claimed or has any other claim errors or warnings associated with it.

**Comments**

Allows you to record comments for the claim operation that you are currently undertaking.

**Claim a Drawing Item**

1. In the **Drawing** view or **Engineering Data Editor**, select the items that you want to claim.
2. Select **Edit** > **Claim** to display the **Claim** dialog.
3. Record comments about this claim operation. In the **Items to be claimed** list, fill in the **Comments** box. The comments will be applied to all the items in the **Items to be claimed** list.

A newly placed item is automatically claimed by the project that placed it (not applicable for Smart P&ID Engineering).

Remember that objects are claimed by the *project*, not by a single user. After a project claims an item, it can be modified by anyone with the appropriate permissions in that project.

In Exclusive claim mode, the software allows the user to claim all the selected items that were not already claimed by other projects. The claim log shows which items could not be claimed because they were already claimed by other projects.

Claiming items clears the Undo stack. Thus, claiming is not an undoable command.

You can only claim an item in the **Engineering Data Editor** if that item belongs to the active drawing.

**Enforcing Claims**

Whether you are using shared or exclusive claiming mode, claiming objects to your project involves many special relationships. The following topics discuss some of the ways that claiming restricts your activities.

The claim mode (Exclusive or Shared) is defined in Options Manager for the Plant and all its projects. When you claim an item, it is claimed to your active project. No items are ever claimed by the Plant.

**Controlling Access**

Each command in the software checks your permissions for the items that it modifies. When possible, commands simply do not allow the operation to proceed if you do not have the necessary permissions. In cases where the software cannot prevent you from initiating a command, an error message is displayed.

You must have full control permissions on P&ID Objects before you can claim any drawing items. See User Access in *Smart Engineering Manager Help*.

**Modifying Properties**

Claiming impacts properties modifications in the following manner.

**Properties Window**

When you select a claimed item, the **Properties** window allows the properties of that item to be viewed and modified. When you select an item that has not been claimed, the **Properties** window allows the properties to be viewed but not modified. The properties of unclaimed items are read-only.

When you select a line segment, the **Properties** window displays the properties of the associated pipe or signal run. If the run has been claimed, the properties can be edited; otherwise, the properties are read-only.

326/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

When you select multiple items, if they are all claimed, the **Properties** window allows them to be modified. If any of the selected items are not claimed, the **Properties** window treats the whole group as read-only.

**Engineering Data Editor (EDE)**

If the item has been claimed, you can edit its properties through the EDE; otherwise, the EDE treats the item properties as read-only. The EDE behaves similarly to the **Properties** window.

**Consistency Check Dialog**

The **Solutions** section of the **Consistency Check** dialog allows you to copy property values from one item to another. For the selected solution, if the destination item is not claimed, the **Apply** button is not available.

**Implied Items**

When a drawing item is claimed, it means that you can modify that model item and all of its implied items. If a model item is not claimed, the user cannot modify any of the implied items that the model item owns.

**Placement Rules**

When a new relationship is created, such as when you place a nozzle on a vessel, the applicable rules copy property values across the relationship. When a relationship to an unclaimed item is created, properties can be copied *from* that item without any problem; however, if the rule calls for properties to be copied *to* an unclaimed item, the action is not allowed, and the properties are not copied. An inconsistency indicator shows the inconsistency between the two related items.

**Placing and Moving Drawing Items**

Sometimes the target item must be claimed, but other times it does not have to be claimed. The following list explains how the relationship between an object and its target effects claiming.

**Placing Nozzles**, **Equipment Components**, **Room Components**, or **Instrument Components**: The target item does not need to be claimed.

**Placing Piping Components or Instruments in Pipe or Signal Runs**: The target run must be claimed. In certain cases, placing a piping component or inline instrument causes a zero-length line segment to be created and automatic line connectivity causes it to be joined to an existing run. The target of that zero-length line must be claimed.

**Placing Reducers**: A reducer is a “line-breaking component”. The target pipe run and all of its components must be claimed.

**Placing Flow-Oriented Components**: A flow-oriented component sets the flow direction of the target process run, if it is not already set. The target process run must be claimed. You can place a flow arrow label, however, if the flow direction is already defined.

**Placing OPCs on Runs**: The target connector must be claimed.

If the target item needs to be claimed but is not claimed, then you cannot place your item onto the target; the target will not highlight, and your item will not “snap” into position. If no type of placement is allowed at that point, the “no place” indicator

is displayed. In most cases, freestanding placement is still allowed.

**Geometric Modifications**

Geometric operations include a geometric move, with the ALT key pressed where necessary, a rotation, a mirroring, and a scale or parametric modification. The selected symbol does not have to be claimed to perform these operations. None of the connected items have to be claimed either.

**Rotation and Mirroring of Inline Components**

Rotations of 180 degrees and mirroring about the local y-axis for inline components are special geometric modifications cases because the lines are disconnected before and reconnected after the operations.

Therefore, the lines, but not the selected symbol, must be claimed before these operations are allowed. If the lines are not claimed, the standard claim violation message displays.

**Rule-Based Moves**

All connected items must be claimed, as described above. If the required connected items are not all claimed, the move operation can become a geometric move, as if you pressed the ALT key.

**Placing and Modifying Lines**

Sometimes the target item must be claimed, sometimes not. Here is a list of the cases where claiming plays a role:

**Routing Lines up to Nozzles**:The nozzles do not have to be claimed.

**Routing Lines up to Freestanding Piping Components or Instruments**: The piping component or instrument must be claimed because it will be adopted by the new run.

**Routing Lines up to Owned Piping Components or Instruments**: The piping component or instrument does not have to be claimed. In certain cases, when routing a line segment up to an existing inline component, automatic line connectivity will cause an existing zero length run to be joined to the new run. The target run must be claimed.

**Routing Lines up to OPCs:** The OPC does not have to be claimed.

**Routing Lines up to Another Pipe or Signal Run:** The target run must be claimed.

If the target item needs to be claimed but is not claimed, you are not allowed to connect to the target. The black connection handle does not appear at the required point.

**Geometric Modification**

If you move a line segment or a line vertex that is internal to a line, then the piping or signal run that owns the selected segment does not have to be claimed.

**Extreme End of a Run**

If you modify the start point of the first line segment in a run or the end point of the last line segment in a run, then the following stipulations apply:

1. The selected run must be claimed.
2. The target item might need to be claimed.
3. If the existing connected item is a branch point for the run, then the run it belongs to must be claimed because the branch point is deleted and the adjacent line segments in the existing connected run are merged.
4. If a component is connected to the endpoint, it does not need to be claimed.

**Internal Vertex of a Run**

Modification of an internal vertex can result in the run being split; consequently, the following stipulations apply:

1. The entire run and all components must be claimed.
2. The target item might need to be claimed.

**Breaking and Joining Runs**

The **Break Run** command allows you to split one piping or signal run into two pieces. The run to be broken and all components within that run must be claimed.

The **Join Runs** command allows you to combine two connected piping or signal runs into a single run. Both of the runs and all components in both runs must be claimed.

**Placing and Modifying Labels**

The target item for a label usually does not need to be claimed. However, claiming plays a role in the following cases:

**Placing Driving Labels**

A driving label sets one or more properties on the labeled item. The target item must be claimed. This includes flow arrow labels, unless the flow direction is already defined for the process run.

**Placing Labels on Area Breaks**

Placing a label on an area break causes a dynamic property to be added to the area break. For this to happen, the area break must be claimed.

If you modify a label, you do not need to claim it. However, modifying a driving label modifies the labeled item. Therefore, you must claim the item.

329/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Deleting a driving label nulls the value on the related object.

**Place Multiple Representations Command**

This **Stockpile** command enables you to place an additional representation of an existing equipment item into the design in a different drawing, thus creating a multiple representation in the database. You must claim the selected equipment item before this command is made available on the **Stockpile** menu in the EDE.

**Placing and Modifying Area Breaks**

The placement of an area break does not create any new relationships and therefore does not require any claiming. Modifying an area break allows the shape to be changed. This is a purely geometric modification, and so no claiming is required.

**Placing Gaps**

Placing a gap symbol into a piping or signal line implies that the target line must be claimed. If the target line run is not claimed, it is not highlighted as a valid target when you move the pointer over it.

**Replacing Drawing Items**

The **Replace** and **Replace Mode** commands replace one item representation in the design with a different representation and change the value of the “type” attribute for the design item. To replace an item using these commands, you must claim that item.

**Replace Mode**

The claim status check takes place as you move the pointer over the target. If the target is not claimed, the target is not highlighted as a valid replacement target.

**Find and Replace**

Items that are not claimed can be found, but they cannot be replaced. The **Replace** button is not available if an unclaimed item is selected.

**Deleting Items**

Claiming impacts item deletion in the following manner.

**Drawing Items**

Drawing items are deleted from a design using a number of different commands: **Delete to Stockpile** > **Plant**, **Delete to Stockpile** > **Drawing**, **Delete from Model**, and **Cut**. When implementing these commands, all dependent items must be claimed. That is, all items that are to be deleted along with a https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

selected item must be claimed. Any lines attached to or dependent on selected items must be claimed. If any attached or dependent items are not claimed, an error message appears if you attempt to delete them.

It is not permitted to delete an item that has an invalid claim status. If you attempt to delete one or more items on a drawing that have invalid claims, the deletion will fail for those items and an error message will be displayed. The SP_ID and Item Tag for those items will be logged in the Smart P&ID log file.

The following table lists dependent items which must be claimed, item type by item type.

All item notes

All runs with lines that attach to the instrument

**Stockpile Items**

Most items in the stockpile do not have any relationships. For these items, if the item is claimed, it can be deleted from the stockpile. If the item is not claimed, the **Delete** command opens the standard claim violation message.

Plant item groups, for example loops, packages, and so forth, exist in the stockpile and have relationships to member items on a drawing or in a stockpile. If the plant item group is claimed and all of its members are claimed, then the plant item group can be deleted. If the plant item group or any of its members is not claimed, the **Delete** command opens the standard claim violation message.

When an OPC is in the stockpile, it maintains its relationship to the partner OPC. OPCs can be deleted from the stockpile only if both OPCs in a pair are in the stockpile and are deleted at the same time. In a project context, both OPCs in a pair must be claimed before they can be deleted.

**Moving Between Stockpiles**

The Move to Different Stockpile command in the Engineering Data Editor allows you to move an item from one stockpile to a different stockpile. The selected model item must be claimed before you can use this command (if you are using a Project).

**Validating Properties**

The software uses validation functions before setting properties on items. The software checks the claim status before setting any values. If the item is claimed, the property can be changed. If the item is not claimed, the property cannot be changed. For more information about validating properties, select **Start** > https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

You can use the validation and calculation functions on drawing item type. The software uses the same automation interface managing all other item types.

**To Do List and Correlating Items**

Claiming impacts the To Do List and other SmartPlant commands in the following manner.

**Create Task**

Running a Create task creates a new item in the stockpile. The new item is claimed automatically as soon as it is created.

**Update Task**

Running an Update task sets or changes some properties of an existing item. The item to be updated must be claimed before it can be updated. If it is not claimed, the task status is set to **Error** and a note is added to the **Notes** area on the **General** tab of the **Task Properties** dialog.

**Delete Task**

Running a Delete task causes the target item to be deleted. The item to be deleted and possibly other related items must be claimed before the task can do its work. If all of the necessary items are not claimed, the task status is set to **Error** and a note is added to the **Notes** area on the **General** tab of the **Task** **Properties** dialog.

**Correlate Item**

The **SmartPlant** > **Correlate** command correlates pipe runs to the same design basis as an existing pipe run that is already correlated. Properties are copied from the primary pipe run to the other pipe runs. You must claim the pipe runs to be modified. If they are not claimed, they cannot be correlated.

Creating or deleting tasks is not allowed in Smart P&ID Engineering.

**Reviewing a Claim Status**

Use the **Claim Status** command to see if an item has been claimed. This command displays a dialog that shows if the item is claimed by this project or by any other project and, if it is claimed, the date of the operation, the name of the user and any related comments.

Another way to see which items are claimed is with the **Show Claims** command, which paints the items on the drawing with different colors depending on whether the item has been claimed. The typical way to configure the colors is to show unclaimed items in a light gray color and claimed items with their normal symbology. With the **Show Claims** switch turned on, you can very quickly see what is claimed and what is not.

**Claim Status Command**

Opens the Claim Status Dialog, which displays the details of the claimed state of the selected items and

enables you to claim items, release the claims to items, and so forth. You must select the items in the Drawing view or the **Engineering Data Editor** before using this command.

**Claim Status Dialog**

Opens when you select one or more items and select **Edit** > **Claim Status** on the main menu bar. You can review the details of the claimed state of the selected items, claim items, release the claims to items, and discover other details of the claim status. To perform an action on an item (claim, release claim, or show details), you must first select the row of the item. Hold down CTRL or SHIFT to select multiple items.

**Item Tag**

**Claimed by Others**

Indicates the claim status of items claimed by other projects. The symbols are the same as for the **Claimed** column. If you are working in ‘Exclusive mode’, you cannot claim an item that is already claimed by another project.

**Claim**

Opens the **Claim** dialog, where you can claim the item and record claim comments.

**Release Claim**

Releases the claim from your project. A confirmation message is displayed; choose **Yes** to release the claim.

**Details**

Opens the **Details** dialog, where you can discover what project has claimed the selected item, the user that claimed it, and any claim comments that were entered when it was claimed.

**Details Dialog**

Displays details about the claim status of the item that you selected in the **Claim Status** dialog. You can discover the project that has the claim, the user that claimed the item, and claim comments that were entered when the claim was made. Because newly placed items are automatically claimed by the project that places them, their claim comments are always “New Item”. This dialog opens when you select **Details** on the **Claim Status** dialog. You can select all the items in the list by using CTRL + A, and using CTRL + C

makes the selected items available to paste into another document.

The **New Item** entry is automatically added to the comments for an item that is new to the drawing. New items are automatically claimed to the project that created them.

**Show Claims Command (View Menu)**

Sets the appearance of drawing objects as it is specified in the **Claims** tab of the **View Properties** dialog.

You can use this command to switch the claim symbology on and off. Using the options on the **Claims** tab causes only the color and line weight to change, not the line pattern.

**Display Claim Status in the Drawing Symbology**

You can define the line color and weight used to designate claim status on the **Claims** tab of the **View** **Properties** dialog.

If you turn on the display of claim status in the drawing, then when you print the drawing, the claim status will be plotted.

**Releasing a Claimed Item**

If an item is initially claimed by a project, but then later it is decided that the item does not need to be modified, you can remove the item from the project scope using the **Release Claim** command. New items that are automatically claimed when they are created cannot be *unclaimed* with this command.

**Release Claim Command**

Displays the Release Claim Dialog and allows you to relinquish control (by your project) of the selected items. This dialog also displays when you attempt to unclaim an item that has been modified in the project.

Claims must be released before projects can be completed or for other projects to be able to check in drawings with changes.

In Smart P&ID only, you can use the **Compare and Refresh** command to revert the item back to the As-Built state prior to unclaiming.

If you are working in a SmartPlant environment and there are any differences between an item in the Project and an item in the As-Built, the claim cannot be released. If you are not working in the SmartPlant environment, the claim can be released. Also, items that display no warnings or errors are released.

This command can only be used for items that belong to the active drawing.

**Release Claim Dialog**

Opens when you select an item and select **Edit** > **Release Claim** on the main menu bar and displays details of the items that you select to be released from claiming.

**Items to be released**

Lists the items that are selected in the Drawing view or **Engineering Data Editor** and their details. These are the items that you release from your project when you select **OK**. You can also select multiple elements of this list. In this list, you can also see if a selected item has not been claimed nor does it have any other errors or warnings associated with it.

2. Right-click the item or select set and select **Release Claim**. If there are any errors or warnings during

the release, the Release Claim Dialog displays. Review any warnings and error messages about each item.

1. Select **OK** to complete the claim release operation.

After setting the claim mode to **Release Claim**, the status of the items still remains behave exactly in the same way as the scoped items as the software re-scopes them.

You cannot release the claim on an item that is claimed to your project if it is a new item that was created in your project.

You can also release claims on items when you display their claim status. See Display the Claim

Status of a Drawing Item.

You can only release the claim on an item in the **Engineering Data Editor** if that item belongs to the active drawing.

**Viewing Overlapping Drawings**

When a drawing is fetched or checked out to multiple projects, changes might be made simultaneously to the same object(s). The **Show Overlapping** feature allows you to compare a drawing in different projects by displaying the drawing views on top of each other. Any newly placed or modified object can thus be easily identified, and the drawing can then be edited to avoid positioning conflicts.

The **Show Overlapping** command can be executed from Smart P&ID Drawing Manager or from the Smart P&ID Modeler. In both cases, the overlapping view opens in the Smart P&ID Modeler. To enable the **Show** **Overlapping** command in Smart P&ID Drawing Manager, select any drawing in the List view.

**Finishing a Project**

Finishing a project is a two-step procedure: First, you must complete the project, and then you must merge the project back into the Plant.

**Complete a Project**

1. In Drawing Manager, open the **Project Status** dialog.
2. Select the **Complete Project** button.

This command performs several tests, including verifying all the drawings for check in. If the project passes all the tests, the project status is set to **Completed**. If the project fails to pass one of the tests, the project remains in the **Active** state and you have more work to do before completing the project.

The **Verify for Check In** command in Drawing Manager allows you to perform the same tests on individual drawings that are done by the **Complete Project** process on all drawings. This allows you to check if individual drawings are ready for check in as work on them is completed.

Before a project can be completed, all the drawings that exist in the project must be checked out (not just fetched). Checking out a drawing to a project means that this project is the only one that can check it back into the plant.

All drawings must be up-to-date with the version in the Plant. If another project has checked in changes to one of the project drawings because it was fetched from the Plant, then the project will fail to complete. In this case, you must refresh the affected drawings before the project can be completed.

This ensures that overlapping projects with shared drawings do not destroy each other’s changes. If projects do not share any drawings, this is not an issue.

**Merge a Project**

1. After completing a project, the next step of finishing the project is to merge the project back into the Plant. Merging the project causes all the changes that were made in the project to be merged back into the Plant. Prior to merging, the Plant is not affected by any of the changes that are done in the project. After merging, all the project changes are incorporated into the Plant database.In Drawing Manager, open the **Project Status** dialog.
2. Select **Merge Project**.

*This command performs the check in operation on each of the checked-out drawings and sets the* *state of the project to **Merged**.*

In some workflows, it is desirable to merge some of the drawings back into the Plant before the project is completed. Individual drawings can be merged into the Plant with the **Check In** command in Drawing Manager.

Merged projects cannot be returned to active status.

**Cancel a Project**

If you decide that a project should not be merged into the Plant, the other alternative is to cancel the project.

Canceling a project causes all the project changes to be discarded. Canceled projects cannot be returned to the **Active** status.

1. In Drawing Manager, open the **Project Status** dialog.
2. Select the **Cancel Project** button.

**Comparing and Refreshing Versions**

When more than one version of a drawing exists, you can view two versions side-by-side and examine their differences by using the **Tools** > **Compare and Refresh** command. You can compare two versions from inside your own Plant or project database, or you can compare a version in your database to a version in the Plant or another project database. Keep in mind that you can compare a drawing only against a version of itself; that is, you cannot compare one drawing to another drawing.

Differences between drawing versions are assigned to logical change groups, which are listed on the **Change groups** area of the **Compare and Refresh** dialog. Differences display in the following two categories.

**Graphic** refers to an item that has changed only in its graphical representation in the design; that is, the item is moved or otherwise graphically manipulated in the drawing.

**Data** refers to a mismatch in the properties assigned to an item that exists in both drawings; that is, a change, addition, or deletion of a property in the **Properties** window or **Engineering Data Editor** in Smart P&ID or through automation.

Every change grouping and every changed item is assigned a category, and if more than one category applies (for instance, if you move an item and change one of its properties), then the highest priority category is displayed.

**Change details** displays information about selected groups in the **Change groups** area. Values include the following.

**Add**

Indicates that the selected group will be added to the version displaying on the right.

**Delete**

Indicates the selected group will be removed from the version displaying on the right.

**Modify**

Indicates the selected group will be modified on the version displaying on the right.

The two versions are displayed in two Drawing views, described as left and right views. The relationship between the two views depends on whether you are comparing two versions in your own database or comparing your version to a version in another database.

**Comparing two** **versions in the active database:** The left-hand view is the older version, and the right-hand view is the newer version. That is, they are displayed in time-order from left to right.

**Comparing two versions that exist in different databases**: The right-hand view is reserved for the version in your active Plant or project database, and the left-hand view belongs to the version in another database because you cannot be assured that time-order is the logical order to display the versions.

You can also compare the differences between the typicals of either drawing. Using the select list situated in the drawing name bar of each view, you can display the primary, typical, or both views of the selected version.

To refresh any differences between these two versions, you must set the **Action** column to **Refresh**.

Change groups are marked if the changes affect items you have claimed. Be sure to refresh all of the changes that do not involve claimed items because these are the changes that have been checked in by other projects. You want to include these changes in your drawing so they will not be lost when you perform a check in.

When a plant item group is sent to the Plant Stockpile and after creating a new version of the drawing, that plant item group is assigned to a piece of equipment or an instrument, the **Change** column displays the value **Delete**. On refreshing the change group, the plant item group assignment will be removed; however, the plant item group will remain on the Plant Stockpile and will not be deleted. Plant Item Group types that are affected by this behavior are: Contract Package, Hydro Test Package, Package, Instrument Safety Class, Test System, and Hydraulic Circuit. If the plant item group is sent to the *drawing* stockpile, the behavior is identical. However, the **Change** column displays the value **Modify**.

**Compare and Refresh Command (Tools Menu)**

Allows you to refresh the active drawing with data from another version of the drawing. The differences display in what is known as a change group. If you accept the changes, the drawing refreshes to display the changes.

To refresh a project drawing, you use the drawing in the plant. hange groups are marked if it affects items you have claimed. Be sure to refresh all of the changes that do not involve claimed items because these are the changes that have been checked in by other projects. You want to include these changes in your drawing so they will not be lost when you perform a check in.

**Compare With Dialog**

Opens when you select **Tools** > Compare and Refresh allowing you to select a drawing version to compare

against the version that you currently have open and active.

**Available Databases**

Lists all the different databases that currently have a version of the drawing you chose on the **Show History** dialog.

**Compare and Refresh Dialog**

This dialog opens when you select **Tools** > **Compare and Refresh**, displaying two versions of the same drawing and indicating the differences between them. You can also refresh the data to show any changes that were made while this dialog box is open.

You cannot do anything else in the Smart P&ID modeler while this dialog is open.

**Toolbar Commands**

The toolbar commands apply to the **Drawing** views. For icons that display a drop down-arrow, you can apply the command to either the right or left view.

**Compare Options**

Opens the **Compare Options** dialog, which allows you to customize the colors that the various comparison states are displayed in. That color coding is then displayed in the status bar as a static reminder.

**Print**

Prints the **Drawing** view or views.

**Generate Report**

Opens Microsoft Excel and creates a report of the information contained in this comparison session. This report lists the same information that is displayed in the **Change groups** and **Change details** lists (change groups, item types, claim statuses, and so forth).

**Find in List**

Zooms to the **Change details** list entry that corresponds to an item you select in either **Drawing** view. In general, if you select a drawing item that exists in the list, then the list display automatically zooms to that entry.

**Find in Drawings**

Manipulates the **Drawing** views so that the selected element is listed in the **Change details** and the **Change groups** list is centered in the appropriate **Drawing** view. You must first select an item in either the **Change groups** or **Change details** area.

**Zoom Area**

Enlarges the selected area in one or both **Drawing** views by allowing you to draw a fence around the area.

**Zoom In**

Enlarges the selected area where you click.

Allows you to move the display in any direction from a specific point in one or both **Drawing** views in order to see other areas of the view by dragging the pointer across the display.

**Select**

Changes the pointer to an arrow allowing you to select an item.

**Help**

Opens the Online Help.

**Drawing Views**

The left and right drawing views display the two versions of your drawing being compared. The display above the drawing view shows the drawing name and the version. The select list in the display allows you to choose the drawing layers to be compared and can be selected individually for each version. Possible select list values are **Primary**, **Typical**, or **Both**.

If you compare two versions from different projects, the version that belongs to the other project appears in the left **Drawing** view and the version that belongs to your active Drawing Manager project appears in the right **Drawing** view. If you compare two versions from your active project, then the latest version appears in the right **Drawing** view.

At the top of each **Drawing** view, the Plant or project, the name of the drawing, and the version is displayed explicitly. You can move the bars between the different views according to your needs. If you double-click on the divider between the left and right **Drawing** views, then the software automatically adjusts the two views to be the same-size.

**Properties Window**

Displays two columns of properties for an item selected in a **Drawing** view or in the **Change details** list.

The left-hand and right-hand columns correspond to the left and right **Drawing** views. If a deleted item is selected (the item exists in left view, but not the right view), the properties for that item are listed in the left-hand column and the right-hand column is empty. If a modified item is selected, values from both versions show in their respective columns in the **Properties** window. If a new item is selected, that is, the item exists in right view, but not the left view, the properties for that item are listed in the right-hand column and the left-hand column is empty.

**Data Example**

In this example, a jacketed tower exists in the version to be selected for the compare. The current version contains the same jacketed tower but a change has been made to the **Cleaning Requirements** property. When the current version is compared to the selected version, a data change is found during the compare.

The current version appears on the right and the version it is compared to appears on the left. **Change** **groups** indicates that there is only one group and a data change was located. All items in the group are valid claims. **Change details** indicates that the comparison located a different property value (**Cleaning** **Requirement**) in the current version. If you refresh the version, the property value will be modified as shown in the **Change** column. Clicking in the **Action** column of the **Change groups** data allows you to take no action or refresh (accept the new property value).

**Graphic Example**

In this example, a jacketed tower exists in the version to be selected for the compare. The current version contains the same jacketed tower but it has been moved to a new location. When the current version is compared to the selected version, a graphic change is found during the compare.

**Consistency Checking**

Consistency checking verifies the suitability of work that a designer performs while creating the drawing.

The software verifies, in real-time, if the composition of a drawing and the underlying data model satisfy rules that your company has defined. The software includes pre-defined standard industry design propagation: for example, pipe runs inherit properties from nozzles. Additional consistency checking and design propagation are defined in Rule Manager.

Consistency checking continuously monitors your work when you change or add items on a drawing. The software displays all the inconsistencies, describes specific problems, and offers hints. Using these solutions, you can decide the best method to resolve an inconsistency. One solution is to approve a warning and thereby remove the inconsistency from the drawing. Another solution is to copy the same value from one side to the other side and then propagate.

This illustration shows the inconsistency indicators that highlight incorrect relationships at a junction of items in a drawing. An error appears where the pipe run connects to the pump nozzle (A). A warning appears at the point where the valve and pipe run intersect (B). An approved warning accompanies the off-page connector (C).

**Consistency Checking and Break Labels**

A property break is a point in a connected network of objects where a property value changes. A user can define a property break by the placement of a break label. A property break is an exception to the consistency criteria defined in a rule. A property break defines a limitation to the spread of the propagation scope. Whereas rules provide the general definition of the scope, property breaks provide specific limitations of the scope.

The Consistency Check Dialog shows the consistency criteria that apply at the selected relationship

indicator. All of the properties that are copied and compared across this connection are shown. After placement of a break label, the copy and compare columns show icons that indicate that no copy and compare operations are performed for the properties in the label.

Break labels can be created in the **Catalog Manager** environment. A break label is created just like an ordinary label, except that the Label Type property must be set to *Attribute Break*. A SmartText field must be created for each property that the break label is intended to break. A break label can break one or more properties. This functionality is all currently supported by the Catalog Manager. No new functionality is required.

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Break labels can be placed directly from the **Catalog Explorer**. A group of break labels is currently delivered under Piping\SegmentBreaks. Break label placement is enhanced so that a break label can only be placed at a connection point where the specified properties are being propagated. When a break label is placed interactively, the corresponding property break data is added to the Relationship object.

Break labels can be deleted in the standard way using the **Delete** command. When a break label is deleted the break is removed from the Relationship object. However, if there is another break label at this same point that also breaks this property, then the break would not be removed.

Redundant breaks do not appear as inconsistencies on drawings. To identify these, you must use the **Find Redundant Breaks** command. Redundant breaks are break components, attribute breaks, and pipe segment breaks where those properties for which a discontinuity is expected are the same on either side of the break.

**Show Inconsistencies Command (View Menu)**

Turns on or off the display of indicators that identify inconsistent relationships in the active view. The software does not mark consistent, error-free relationships.

**Show Inconsistencies**

1. Select **View** > Show Inconsistencies. When this option is selected, inconsistent relationship indicators

appear in the drawing.

1. If you do not want the inconsistencies to appear, select **View** > Show Inconsistencies again to clear

the selection of the option.

Also, you can right-click in an empty portion of the drawing to display a shortcut menu. Select Show

Inconsistencies to toggle the display of inconsistencies off and on.

**Consistency Check Command (Edit Menu)**

Right-click an inconsistency indicator and choose **Consistency Check** to display the Consistency Check

Dialog. As you create a drawing, consistency checking monitors your drawing for design discrepancies. If a location in the drawing has only one or multiple inconsistencies, you can correct the problems by reviewing them on the Consistency Check Dialog.

**Consistency Check Dialog**

Opens when you display the properties of an inconsistency indicator, and lists the inconsistencies, their specific problem area, and solutions for resolving the inconsistency. The dialog also displays the consistency criteria and propagation breaks that apply at the selected relationship indicator.

You open this dialog by right-clicking an inconsistency indicator and choosing **Consistency Check** from the shortcut menu. You can also select **Edit** > **Consistency Check**.

automatically selects the first item in the list. Other sections of the dialog provide details that are specifically related to the selected inconsistency.

All inconsistencies that occur at a junction, regardless of severity, are listed on the **Consistency Check** dialog. When you select one of the inconsistencies in the list, the software displays information specific to that inconsistency in the **Solutions** box. A specific example of this type can involve data inconsistencies for nominal pipe diameter, normal operating temperature, and alternate design pressure between a piping component and pipe run. This represents three different problems but at the same junction.

The **Consistency Check** dialog contains the **Inconsistencies Tab** and the **Consistency Criteria Tab**.

**Inconsistencies Tab (Consistency Check Dialog)**

All of the properties that are compared by consistency checking and copied across this connection by propagation are shown on these tabs. The information shown here is very similar to the information shown on the **Consistency** tab of the **Rule Properties** dialog in the **Rule Manager**. Open the Consistency Check

**Importing Drawing Data**

There are several ways you can import data into Smart P&ID. You can import data and items into the database using reports and other files. SmartSketch files can be imported into Smart P&ID using the SmartPlant Migrator wizard. Also, you can also populate or redefine pipe run properties by importing an Aspen Basic Engineering stream data file. During the import process, you can assign the stream and its associated engineering data to the pipe run.

**Import > Data File Command (File Menu)**

Allows you to import data and items into the database from reports and other files.

Relationships between items cannot be imported, only items and their properties.

**Import Log Dialog**

Shows the progress of the data importation process and allows you to review the log file. This dialog opens when you use the **File** > **Import** > **Data File** command.

**Import log**

Lists the results of the file importing process. These results are also available in SPImport.log, which is saved to your local TEMP folder.

**Import > SmartSketch Command (File Menu)**

Allows you to import data from SmartSketch into Smart P&ID and starts the **SmartPlant Migrator** wizard. In order to import a SmartSketch drawing into Smart P&ID, you must have SmartSketch installed on your computer.

In order to import SmartSketch drawings on Windows 7 when Smart P&ID is installed in the default path: ..\SmartPlant\P&ID Workstation\bin, the user must be an Administrator or have Administrator rights.

**Using the SmartPlant Migrator**

The SmartPlant Migration Wizard is a data migration tool provided by Smart P&ID for converting and importing process flow diagrams (PFDs) and preliminary process and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) from SmartSketch into Smart P&ID. When migrating your SmartSketch file to Smart P&ID, the Migrator maintains graphic visual fidelity. During processing, the Migrator scans the SmartSketch file and maps all the objects to Smart P&ID equivalent objects. Any graphics that cannot be mapped are placed in a SmartSketch file that is then placed as an inserted object in the Smart P&ID file. The database does not contain any information for these unmapped objects.

388/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

**Placement Order**

After the SmartSketch file is scanned and all its objects are mapped to Smart P&ID objects, the Migrator uses rules to determine the order in which to place the resulting symbols. Certain symbols cannot be placed unless a rule has been met. For example, a nozzle cannot be placed unless it is attached to a piece of equipment. SmartSketch does not have rule sets. To account for the rules in Smart P&ID, the Migrator looks at the SmartSketch symbols to determine what the symbols are attached to. Symbol placement is performed in this order:

1. Stand-alone symbols
2. Symbols attached to stand-alone symbols
3. Connectors and pipes

## 4. Symbols attached to connectors or pipes

1. Symbols attached to symbols that are attached to a connector or pipe 6. Labels
2. SmartSketch graphics that are not recognized as symbols

**Rule Considerations**

Because the SmartPlant Migration Wizard cannot account for all the rule possibilities that are defined in the default Smart P&ID rule set or a customized rule set, you must create your SmartSketch drawing with the Smart P&ID rule set in mind. Smart P&ID Rule Manager contains the rules used when creating a P&ID.

This includes default rules and any rules you have created. The P&ID user and the SmartSketch user must collaborate on what the rules allow to be placed in a P&ID so that the SmartSketch drawings account for the different possibilities. For example, if you create a rule for special requirements for equipment or instrumentation placement in your P&IDs, the SmartSketch user needs to be made aware of these rules.

**Supported Templates**

Intergraph Process Flow and P&ID symbols map to the Smart P&ID reference data included with the software.

**Symbols**

Delivered symbols with a matching AABBCC code are mapped intelligently to the equivalent Smart P&ID

symbol, or you can edit a symbol map file to equate the symbol names between SmartSketch and Smart P&ID. You can check the symbol map file, SymbolMap.csv, for duplicate codes. This file is created during the migration process and you can open this file by using Microsoft Excel.

The AABBCC code is not displayed in **Catalog Explorer** or the **Properties** window in Smart P&ID. To view the code, you must open the item in Catalog Manager.

Because SmartSketch is file- driven and Smart P&ID is database-driven, both products have independent sets of symbols; therefore, symbol definitions and attributes migrated from a SmartSketch file are stored as properties in the Smart P&ID database. SmartSketch symbol attributes are conditionally migrated; this means that the attribute must exist as a Smart P&ID property for that symbol. SmartSketch has a default set of attributes for vessels, pumps, compressors, and shell and tube exchangers. These attributes are the same as the Smart P&ID properties for the same items. All of those attributes, if given a value in SmartSketch, migrate to the Smart P&ID property database. You can add your own unique attributes to a P&ID symbol in SmartSketch, and if that same symbol with same properties is available in Smart P&ID, custom SmartSketch attributes can migrate into those properties. You define custom properties for Smart P&ID symbols by using Catalog Manager.

**Nozzles**

Nozzles are required for connection of piping in Smart P&ID. Nozzles are required in the SmartSketch document for connections to be established when converted to Smart P&ID.

**Non-Nozzle Connections**

Piping linear objects not connected to nozzles are placed in Smart P&ID, but are not connected. You have to make valid connections manually in Smart P&ID.

**Flow**

Appropriate flow direction is established based on the terminator of the connector.

**Properties**

User-defined and default SmartSketch properties are mapped to an equivalent Smart P&ID property.

**SmartLabels**

Item tags and other single property labels are maintained intelligently.

Labels in SmartSketch files are migrated very much like symbols. Any label placed in SmartSketch must have an equivalent label in Smart P&ID before it can migrate. SmartSketch does include a subset of the Smart P&ID labels, and most of the common labels are smart labels, which are labels that are associated with one or more object properties. The properties of these smart labels are passed to the symbol to which they are attached and migrate to Smart P&ID.

In order to assign an AABBCC code to a Smart P&ID label so that it matches a SmartSketch label, do the following.

1. Open the P&ID label in Catalog Manager.

1. Right-click the symbol page in order to open the **File Properties** dialog, and select the **Symbol** tab.
2. In the **Name** box, type **AABBCC_code**.
3. In the **Type** box, select **Text**.
4. In the **Value** box, enter the appropriate AABBCC code, for example, **1F6Y01**.

**Unrecognized Graphics and Annotations**

All unrecognized graphics are inserted in the Smart P&ID drawing as embedded SmartSketch graphics.

This rule maintains visual fidelity even if there are items that could not be mapped intelligently.

**Limitations**

The following list shows planned limitations of the Migrator:

Multiple iterations are not supported

Flow direction that is indicated by using symbols is not understood The primary goal is not to take fully developed P&IDs into a data-centric environ *men* t The SmartSketch Migrator converts entire files only. If you want to migrate only a portion of a file, select the geometry that you want to migrate and copy and paste it into another file. Then the file you just created can migrate.

In order to import a SmartSketch drawing into Smart P&ID, you must have SmartSketch installed on your computer.

You can determine if all the graphics in your file migrated correctly by viewing the GetSmart.log file in the Temp folder. This file contains information about the migration such as the file that was migrated, the time that the migration started and stopped, the symbols that were migrated, and any errors encountered during the migration.

**Import a SmartSketch File**

To import SmartSketch drawings into Smart P&ID, you must have SmartSketch installed on your computer.

To be able to import SmartSketch drawings when Smart P&ID is installed in the default path:

..\SmartPlant\P&ID Workstation\bin, the user must be an Administrator or have Administrator rights.

**Importing Aspen Basic Engineering Stream Data**

You can populate or redefine pipe run properties by importing an Aspen Basic Engineering stream data file.

During the import process, you can assign the stream and its associated engineering data to the pipe run.

You can easily update stockpile items that originate from importing Aspen Basic Engineering data by re-importing a data file. Previously imported items, whether they remain in the stockpile or have already been placed in the drawing, are updated with data from the newly imported file.

If a format change is made to an exported Aspen Basic Engineering report, modifications must be made to the import code to accommodate the changed report layout. See the Smart P&ID

Programmer’s Help.

**Import Aspen Basic Engineering Stream Data**

1. Select a pipe run from the drawing to display the **Properties** window for the pipe run. If the **Properties** window is not open, you can select **Edit** > **Properties** after you select the pipe run.
2. Select the **Calculate** button next to the **Stream No**. cell to display the **Stream Number** dialog.
3. Select the **Browse** button and select the Aspen Basic Engineering stream data .txt file from the appropriate folder.
4. Select the **Stream ID** list and select a stream ID.
5. Select **OK** to populate the **Properties** window with the selected stream ID.

**Generating Reports**

Reporting is the process of extracting data from a database and presenting it in a formatted output. In Smart P&ID, you can create a report at any time during the design creation process and each report consists of a Microsoft Excel workbook and a report definition. The report definition specifies what data to collect and how to organize it in the workbook.

Each report that you create is based on specific item type, such as equipment, nozzle, instrument, and pipe run. The item type serves as the starting point for collecting data for the report.

The report definition contains one or more report items organized in a tree hierarchy. Every report must have at least one item to define its type, for example, an equipment item for a report about equipment. The report item provides all the available properties of each piece of equipment, but you can choose which properties to include.

You can customize reports by only adding necessary report items to access additional properties of related items. For example, include a nozzle report item to gather data about nozzles, as they are related to equipment. Relationships between the item types provide additional information for reports. When creating a report, you can only use items related to the selected item type. To understand the item relationships and map necessary properties into report templates, see Properties Glossary.

The report item’s location in the tree hierarchy affects the properties collected for the associated item type.

For example, if a nozzle is added as the top-level item in the tree, all nozzles in the database are collected for the report. If the nozzle is added as a child of an equipment, only the information about nozzles that are related to that equipment are collected.

Smart P&ID provides you with default report templates, which you can use as-is or create a custom report

that meets your requirements. For more information on creating custom report templates, see Creating and

editing report templates.

We’ve upgraded Smart P&ID to .NET, as a result, you must update any custom reports that you created in versions 2014 R1 or earlier. You can update the custom reports in two ways: Automatic - When you edit or run a report, ensure to enable automatic update.

Manual - You can manually update the VBA code in Excel.

**Generate a report for an active drawing**

You can generate report on an active drawing using either the selected items or all the items in the drawing.

Ensure you have Microsoft Excel installed on your computer to view the report.

Before running any Line List report, verify that every line in the selection has an **Item Tag**.

display the specific information that you want. So the software allows you to define report templates in several different formats and with all manner of information from the design database.

You can create report templates in three different formats:

Tabular Format Report

Fixed Format Report

Composite Format Report

The delivered report templates are all tabular format reports. Fixed and composite format templates allow the greatest amount of freedom in formatting your report.

Not only can you completely control the format of your report, but you can control the content of the template also. Each report is based on a unique item type, and the properties that are associated with that item type are readily available to include in your report. In addition, any item that is related in any way to the basic item type of your report makes its properties available to include in the definition of your template, too.

For instance, the properties of inline components and instruments can be used in a pipe run report because inline components are related to their pipe runs. In order to discover how items and their properties are related, and thereby how you can map the properties that you want into your report templates, see the *Properties Glossary*, which is included in the glossaries attached to *Smart P&ID Help*.

**Portable report templates**

In previous versions of the software, when a property is mapped to a report template, the template file stores an internal identifier for that property; thus, that report template is tightly linked to the plant that creates the property. Now the property *name* is mapped into the report template; therefore, as long as all plants use the same property name, the same report template is valid.

When creating a new report template, the software saves the file *.xlsm for Excel 2007 or a newer version and *.xls for older versions of Excel.

For the reports to work properly, ensure that the **Safe mode (helps limit the control’s** **access to your computer)** is selected in Excel **Options** > **Trust Center** > **Trust Center Settings** > **ActiveX Settings**.

**Enable Automatic Update of Custom Reports**

From Version 2019, the VBA code was updated for all shipped reports in accordance with the software migration to .NET. In order to make a similar update for your custom reports, this procedure explains how to enable custom reports by injecting a new VBA function automatically whenever you run a custom report.

**Tabular Format Report**

All the delivered report templates are tabular format reports. When the report is generated, all properties populate the report by using the same format defined for the first row by means of macros. In other words, tabular format reports are row-based. The **Options** command on the **Add-Ins** tab of the Excel sheet is important for setting aside space for the header and empty rows between lines in the report because the placement of report item properties is restricted in the tabular format report template.

For example, the report template for an Equipment List can appear like this: Equipment Name

Equipment Description

Equipment Type

#Equipment::Name#

#Equipment::Description#

#Equipment::Type#

When the report is generated, the output appears like this:

Equipment Name

Equipment Description

Equipment Type

D-100

Horizontal Drum 100

Horizontal Drum

T-100

Potable Water Tank

Vertical Tank

**Define the Layout of a Tabular Format Report Template**

You can edit your tabular format report template in Microsoft Excel and specify how the labels and data are displayed.

1. On the **Add-Ins** tab of the Excel sheet, select **Options** .
2. In the **Report Options** dialog, choose the size of your report header by setting a value in the **Rows in** **report header** option.

The header is part of the tabular format report template where data is not mapped based on rows. That is, you are free to type a label and map report item properties anywhere in the lines that you designate for your header.

The header is a good place to put information that applies to all the items in your report, such as Unit or Plant Name.

Also, you can add graphics in your report header.

Be sure to include space in your header for the labels of your columns.

If an item property is added in the header and more than one value for that property exists (including null values), separate tabs will be created in the generated report for each common value; for example, if items of equipment appear in a report with the **Number of Trays** property shown in the header area, where vessels have 2 or 3 as the number of trays and where trays are not applicable for other equipment items, three tabs will appear in the report: one for items having 2 trays, one for items having 3 trays, and one for items that do not include the **Number of Trays** property (null value).

1. Choose the number of empty lines that you want between rows in your report. Each row is filled with properties for one item.

Some report templates, for example some Line List reports, designate two rows of data for each report item and then an empty row.

1. If you want to sort the map properties, under **‘Map Properties’ sort order**, select **Ascending** or **Descending**.

When sorted in ascending or descending order, the properties that have sub-properties appear first sorted alphabetically, followed by the properties that do not have sub-properties, sorted alphabetically.

For a summary report, the list entry **Report Item Group Total** that appears at the lowest level is always at the bottom of the list, regardless of the sort order selected.

1. Select **OK** to close the **Report Options** dialog.
2. Complete general labels and graphics, if needed, in your header.
3. Complete column headings in the last row of your header.
4. Select a cell in your report template where you want to map a particular property.

This cell can be either in the body of the report or in the header.

1. Choose the property that you want to map to your cell from the **Map Properties** menu. The items on this menu are chosen when you define the contents of your template. See Define the Contents of Your Report Template.

You only have to map each item property once in the template. Values of the properties for all the items will appear in subsequent rows in the generated report and will follow the format you map for the first instance of the item.

Only one property can be mapped to a given cell, although the same property can be mapped to more than one cell.

1. Repeat the previous steps until you have mapped all the properties that you want to include in this report template.
2. Save the template and exit Microsoft Excel.

The file location of plant-level report templates is specified in Options Manager.

For PID users, the file location of user-level templates is defined on the **Files** tab of the **Options** dialog (**Tools** > **Options**).

If you add any property value in a cell belonging to a row allocated as part of the header, a new Microsoft Excel worksheet is created and the header is saved on the new sheet because the entire header no longer fits in the space allotted on the first sheet. You can customize the number of rows in the report header by using the **Options** command on the **Add-Ins** tab and choosing a larger value in the **Rows in report header** option in the **Report Options** dialog.

**Fixed Format Report**

The fixed format report creates one Microsoft Excel worksheet for each item. When defining the report template, you only edit the first worksheet. When you generate your report, all fixed format worksheets, one for each item of the report item type, follow the format of the first Microsoft Excel worksheet. The **Options** command on the **Add-Ins** tab of the Excel sheet is not available for editing a fixed format report template because you are free to place headers and data anywhere you want on your worksheet.

**Define the Layout of a Fixed Format Report Template**

You can edit your fixed format report template in Microsoft Excel and specify how the labels and data are displayed.

1. Choose a cell on your Microsoft Excel worksheet and type labeling information into it.

A label is not a required feature of a fixed format report template. You can simply map properties to cells without any labeling if you want.

1. Choose a cell where you want the property associated with the labeling to appear.
2. On the **Add-Ins** tab of the Excel sheet, select **Map Properties** and from the menu select the property that you want to map to the cell you chose in the previous step.

The properties on the **Map Properties** menu are specified when you define the contents of your report. See Define the Contents of Your Report Template.

1. Repeat the previous steps until you have labeled and mapped all the needed report item properties to the corresponding locations in your template. When you generate a fixed format report, the data for each report item appears in its own worksheet, and the layout for each worksheet matches the layout defined for the first worksheet.

The **Options** command is not available on the **Add-Ins** tab for fixed format report templates because you are free to place headers and data anywhere on your worksheet.

**Composite Format Report**

For the composite report format, the software creates two Microsoft Excel worksheets for each item type.

You only edit Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 of the workbook. When you generate the report, all the worksheets, two for each item type, follow the format of Sheet 1 and Sheet 2. In the report, properties of the recently added item are displayed in Sheet 1 and Sheet 2. The properties of all other items added before the recent item are displayed in the subsequent sheets.

The delivered report templates are tabular format. Therefore, choose **Blank** from the **Source** **template** list if you want to create a composite format template.

The format for Composite report and Fixed report is similar. Difference between the two is that the Fixed report has one sheet, and the Composite report has two sheets for each item.

properties. If you want to tally similar items in this way, be sure not to map unique properties, such as item tags, onto your report. If you do, then items are never grouped together because a unique tag is a property that items never share.

Select this check box to display the selected units of measure in the report. Clear the check box to display the property values without units of measure.

Formats with primary, secondary, and tertiary units are truncated to the primary value with no rounding when the units are not displayed. Therefore if you clear the **Display units of measure** check box, you might not get accurate results when using such a format. If you do not want to display units of measure, consider using a format that has primary units only.

Use caution when importing a report that contains numerical values without units of measure. In such cases, these numerical values will be imported using the plant default formats, potentially altering the items’ properties. For example, if a report was created with a temperature in Celsius without displaying the units (using an alternative format), a numerical value of 100 in the report (intended as 100 ºC) will be imported as 100 ºF (37.78 ºC) into a plant with ºF as the plant default.

**Display Properties with Units Using an Alternative Format**

This procedure explains how to specify a particular format for displaying in a Smart P&ID report the value of a property that has units of measure. The software displays the numeric value in accordance with the conversion formula specified for the selected format. The user can specify whether to include the units of measure with the displayed value.

1. Select **Reports** > **Edit**.
2. On the **Edit Report Template** dialog, select a report from the **Available reports** list.
3. Select **Open** to display the report in Microsoft Excel.
4. Select the **Add-Ins** tab, and in the **Custom Toolbars** area, select **Options**.
5. On the **Report Options** dialog, ensure that the **Prompt for alternative format** check box is selected.
6. Select **OK** to close the **Report Options** dialog.
7. Choose a cell where you want the property to appear.
8. Select the **Add-Ins** tab, and in the **Custom Toolbars** area, select **Map Properties**.
9. From the menu, select a property with units of measure that you want to map to the chosen cell. The properties on the **Map Properties** menu are specified when you define the contents of your report.

See Define the Contents of Your Report Template.

1. On the **Select Alternative Format for Display** dialog, select the alternative format from the **Format** list. Initially, the default format is selected. To include the units of measure of the alternative format in the display, select **Display units of measure**.

1. Select **OK** to place the property syntax in the cell.

If the format name mentioned in the report template does not exist in the active plant, the cell will be left blank when the report is generated.

1. Save the template and quit Microsoft Excel.

**Example**

Let us assume that the property you want to display is ‘Design Max Pressure’ and that the default format is Pressure-psig.

If the default format is chosen, the value of that property will be displayed in the report with the units of measure defined for that format. The string that appears in the cell is:

#Pipe Run::Design MaxPress::ProcessDesign.Max.Pressure#

If an alternative format named ‘Pressure-BarG’ was chosen to display the property, the string that appears in the cell is:

#Pipe Run::Design MaxPress::ProcessDesign.Max.Pressure[Pressure-BarG]#

If the **Display units of measure** check box was cleared, the property will be displayed using the numerical value of the format without showing the units of measure in the report, and the string that appears in the cell is:

#Pipe Run::Design MaxPress::ProcessDesign.Max.Pressure[Pressure-BarG::-1]#

**Map Properties Command**

Displays a menu of all properties associated with your report. This menu is populated with the items that you define using the **Define** command on the **Add-Ins** tab. The **Map Properties** menu contains a subset of all the properties in the plant database.

You can select a cell in your report template and then assign a property from the **Map Properties** list. The software places the corresponding property in the selected cell. You do not have to map all the properties in the **Map Properties** menu, and you can add properties to the menu by using the **Define** command again.

The **Add-Ins** tab appears in Microsoft Excel when you create or edit a report template.

**Printing Drawings**

You can print your drawings on many different devices ranging from dot matrix printers to laser printers and plotters. Except for the color settings and a few special effects, your drawing prints exactly as it appears in the Drawing view. This stipulation applies to special settings like the display of claimed items, inconsistency indicators, or filtered items.

Print an entire drawing or specific views from a drawing.

Set printing options, such as the range of sheets or number of copies to print.

The software supports plotting using standard Windows plotting capabilities. It also supports pen plotters, subject to the limitations of the device driver. Items look the same on the screen and in the printed drawing.

However, the fonts you select can affect the match between what you see on the screen and what appears on the printed page. Three kinds of fonts affect your work: scalable fonts, printer fonts, and screen fonts.

Use scalable fonts, such as TrueType® fonts, to make sure that what you see on the screen is what appears on the printed page. If you use printer fonts, you must have a corresponding screen font and font size to display each font on the screen. If each screen font you use has a matching printer font, the screen display of the drawing closely matches the printed drawing.

**Printing Part of a Drawing**

You can print selected sheets in a drawing or a selected area. This feature is handy if you are working on a complex drawing and you want to print only certain parts to proof them. You can print all views or certain views. You can print not only drawing items that are selected, but other items that are in the view with the select set print.

**Printing Time**

Drawings can take some time to print. Expect longer print times when you have drawings that contain a large number of the following items:

Curved items

Many fills that have complex colors, patterns, or textures

Large bitmaps

Links to various drawings

The type of printer you have also affects the printing time. PostScript® printers print faster than LaserJet printers, because they can make the necessary calculations faster. Some older versions of PostScript®

printers are slower when compared to the newer ones. The type of controller boards and the amount of RAM in the printer also affect your printing times.

2. In the **Page Setup** dialog, choose **Standard** or **Custom** for the sheet size. If you chose **Standard**, select a standard sheet size from the list.

You can specify a different sheet size for an existing drawing; that is, you can change, for example, a B-size drawing to a C-size. Choose the template size from the list.

The size choices are more limited for a new template than for an existing drawing and the **Custom** option is not available for an existing drawing.

1. For **Custom** sheet size (available for templates only), choose the units of measure and precisions in the **Paper units** box, and then enter values in the width (**W**) and height (**H**) boxes.

The units of measure and precision also determine font size properties for text added in drawing auxiliary graphics.

1. Select **Portrait** or **Landscape**.
2. Specify a watermark if you want a watermark to be displayed. Specify when you want the watermark to be displayed by selecting either the **While working** option or the **While printing** option.

After making changes to the page layout of an existing drawing, in Smart P&ID Drawing Manager you should run the command **File** > **Out-of-Date-Drawings** > **Update**. Se Update Command in * * Drawing Manager Help.

**Integration**

Smart P&ID can exchange design data with the following applications:

Integration with Aspen Basic Engineering™

Integration with HxGN SDx2

Integration with SmartPlant Foundation

Integration with Smart Completions

**Registering Tools**

Before you can publish and retrieve documents from any of the other authoring tools, such as Smart Instrumentation or Smart Electrical, you must register each plant in Smart P&ID with a SmartPlant Foundation database (for Integration 1.0), HxGN SDx2 database (for Integration 2.0), or an Aspen Basic Engineering™ (ABE) database. On registering your plant, the connection allows Smart P&ID to use the **Integration** menu commands. Registration is performed by the System Administrator in Smart Engineering Manager and each plant must be registered only once in an authoring tool.

The software maps a plant and its relevant projects for SPF to a unique integration tool URL, which connects to a single integration tool plant database and its projects. When you use the **Register** command in any of the authoring tools, you are registering an authoring tool plant with the integration tool URL and plant that you specify.

In Smart Engineering Manager, you can register a plant with either SmartPlant Foundation or HxGN

SDx2, but not both. After the plant is registered with one of these integration tools, the option to register with the other tool becomes unavailable on the **Integration** menu.

A plant that is registered with SmartPlant Foundation or HxGN SDx2 can also be registered with ABE, and vice versa.

In Smart P&ID and Drawing Manager, the **Integration** menu is available only when you register a plant with an integration tool.

If a plant is registered with HxGN SDx2, only the Reshare command is available on the **Integration** menu. However, if the plant’s tool schema is older than the Smart P&ID schema version, only the

Upgrade Schema command is available. For plants registered with SmartPlant Foundation or ABE, the **Reshare** command is not available.

If a plant is registered only with ABE, only the **To Do List** command is available on the **Integration** menu. If you subsequently register an ABE plant with another integration tool, other relevant commands on the **Integration** menu become available.

**Integration with Aspen Basic Engineering™**

Aspen Basic Engineering (ABE) is a database-driven productivity tool that integrates all aspects of Basic Engineering and Front-End Engineering Design (FEED). Because of the focus on FEED, ABE allows the customer to import a process simulation, generate a Process Flow Diagram (PFD), Equipment and Instrument datasheets and lists, early cost estimates, and heat exchanger designs.

Integration between Smart P&ID and Aspen Basic Engineering provides a platform for a digitized, data-driven approach for using equipment and stream data as the source for detailed plant design using Smart P&ID

The benefits of this integration are:

Seamless transfer of engineering information from Basic Engineering / FEED to Detailed Engineering and Operation

Reduction in time and effort for execution of the project as the data flow is streamlined High quality and consistent deliverables

Maximized design reuse and increased efficiency for repeat technology deliverables ABE integration works only with the Smart P&ID on-premise environment. ABE integration is not supported in the Intergraph Smart Cloud environment.

**Prerequisites**

The prerequisites for enabling integration between ABE and Smart P&ID are as follows: Your plant is registered with ABE. For details, see Registering a Plant with Aspen Basic Engineering.

The XaltIntegration Windows service is running on the computer where Smart P&ID Web API is installed. For details, see Configure the Xalt Integration service.

In the Configuration Utility’s SPID-ABE Integration Module, the **Pull from ABE** option is activated and the **Pull Interval** value is set.

ABE integration works only with the Smart P&ID on-premise environment. ABE integration is not supported in the Intergraph Smart Cloud environment.

**Source Tag property and related items**

In the current version of the software, integration with ABE is supported for equipment and streams only.

The software uses a read-only property in Smart P&ID, **Source Tag**, to maintain the relationship between the ABE source items and the items generated in Smart P&ID. The value of **Source Tag** is derived from the following ABE properties:

**ItemNumber** for equipment.

**StreamNumber** for streams.

Smart P&ID items that are created from a single ABE source item and share the same ABE **Source Tag** property are called related items. If changes are made in the ABE source item, new tasks are generated in the To Do List which, when executed, synchronize those changes in the related items.

To ensure that that the relationship to the ABE source item is restricted *only* to the related items, the value of the **Source Tag** property is not copied to new items generated as a result of any of the following actions:

In the Smart P&ID modeler, when copying an item with ABE properties in the active drawing.

In Drawing Manager, when copying a drawing containing items with ABE properties within a plant.

In Drawing Manager, when importing a drawing containing items with ABE properties from a different plant or within a plant.

**Equipment naming convention**

For *equipment*, a single ABE source item usually results in the generation of more than one related item in Smart P&ID. These items can be symbols or main assembly items.

The following ABE properties are used to determine the equipment **Item Tag** property value and the number of related items that need to be created, with equivalent Smart P&ID properties (if existing) shown in parentheses:

**NamePrecedent** (**Tag Prefix**)

**ItemSequenceNumber** (**Sequence No.** )

**NumberRequired**

A separate task is generated for each related equipment item in the To Do List. When new items are created, if the total number of required items is greater than 1, their **Item Tag** properties include an alphabetical suffix according to the value of **NumberRequired**, in sequential progression **A**, **B**, **C**… .

**Equipment example**

Consider a newly-created ABE item with the following properties:

**ItemNumber** = **P-100 SRC**

**NamePrecedent** = **P**

**ItemSequenceNumber** = **100**

**NumberRequired** = **4**

This ABE item will generate 4 **Create** tasks in the To Do List. When these tasks are run, they will result in the creation of Smart P&ID items with the following **Item Tag** values: P-100A

P-100B

P-100C

P-100D

Because all four items are assigned to a single ABE source item, they are related items with the same **Source Tag** = **P-100 SRC** and they will be synchronized with any modifications made to the ABE source item. All the properties of the related items are identical except for the **Item Tag** values, which differ by the sequential alphabetical suffixes as shown.

**Streams**

For *streams*, there is one-on-one mapping between the ABE source item and the related item (pipe-run) in Smart P&ID. The value of the **StreamNumber** property in ABE is copied to the **Stream No.**  property in Smart P&ID.

**Task generation in the To Do List**

After modifying data in Aspen Basic Engineering, it is exported by issuing the PFD that contains the data.

Issuing is a manual process performed in ABE.

Data exchange between ABE and Smart P&ID is handled via Xalt, which monitors the ABE database at regular intervals specified by a scheduler. The schedule times are determined as follows The scheduler begins from the time the XaltIntegration service was last started.

The scheduler frequency is set by the **Pull Interval** value in the **SPID-ABE Integration Module** of the **Smart P&ID Web API Configuration Utility**:

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

443/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The **Pull Interval** can have a value between 1 min. and 1440 min. (24h).

If ABE data was issued since the previous time the scheduler was run, Xalt triggers extraction of the ABE

data into Smart P&ID, resulting in the generation of tasks in the To Do List. The types of tasks generated depend on which ABE related items already exist in the database and the latest data that comes from ABE.

The following video (approx. 3½ minutes) describes the processes involved in generating ABE tasks in the To Do List and how data changes in ABE affect the task types:

The following video (approx. 5 minutes) describes how Smart P&ID items generated from ABE equipment and streams are handled and placed in the Design Window:

**General**

The way that tasks are generated depends on the item type:

For streams, the behavior is the same as for any other regular integration item. When a stream is created, updated or deleted in ABE, a task of the relevant type appears in the To Do List.

For equipment, a single ABE source item can specify a number of items in the Smart P&ID detailed design. Also, each item of equipment can be represented by a symbol or an entire assembly.

When a change is made in ABE for equipment, the software calculates the difference between the number of related items currently in the database and the current value of **NumberRequired** among the data retrieved from ABE. According to the result, **Create**, **Update**, and **Delete** tasks are generated in the To Do List for equipment based on the criteria described below.

When the To Do List is open, if a change takes place in ABE, a message is displayed. On the toolbar, select **Refresh** to synchronize the To Do List with the latest ABE data.

**Create tasks for equipment**

Create tasks are generated under the following conditions:

If a new ABE source item is created where no related items currently exist in the database, only **Create** tasks are generated.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

444/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

If **NumberRequired** is greater than the number of related items currently in the database, **Create** tasks are generated for the required additional items.

If no items exist in the database and **NumberRequired** = **1**, the item tag of the equipment to be created will have no suffix value.

If items already exist in the database and **NumberRequired** = **1**, the item remaining after all the other items are deleted will retain the suffix it had previously. If required, the suffix can be removed manually in Smart P&ID.

If a task was not executed and it is not required the next time data is retrieved, the task is deleted from the To Do List; for example: out of 3 **Create** tasks, the first 2 tasks were executed to create items in the database, but the remaining **Create** task was not executed. On the next retrieve, if **NumberRequired** changed from **3** to **2**, the **Create** task that was not executed is no longer needed and is therefore removed from the To Do List automatically.

**Update tasks for equipment**

Update tasks are generated under the following conditions:

Data values for an existing item were changed in ABE.

Data was changed manually in Smart P&ID for a property whose previous value came from ABE.

When an **Update** task is executed for an *assembly* that is in a stockpile, only the properties of the main item of the assembly are updated.

After an assembly created from ABE is placed in the Design Window, it is split into individual symbols

and any updates are made only to the symbol that was the main assembly item. See also Propagation

of ABE properties in an assembly.

If a *new* data value is added for a property in Smart P&ID, an **Update** task will *not* be generated the next time ABE data is retrieved.

A new **Update** task that is generated for changes made in ABE will replace any unexecuted related **Update** task in the To Do List.

**Delete tasks for equipment**

Delete tasks are generated under the following conditions:

If the source item was deleted in ABE, **Delete** tasks are generated for all the related items currently in the database.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

445/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

If the value of **NumberRequired** is less than the number of related items currently in the database, **Delete** tasks are generated for the surplus items.

When a **Delete** task is executed for an *assembly* that was placed in a drawing, only the main item of the assembly is deleted from the drawing.

When a **Delete** task is executed for an assembly that is still in a stockpile, the entire assembly is deleted from the stockpile.

A **Delete** task will override any existing related **Update** tasks in the To Do List that were not executed and will trigger deletion of these **Update** tasks.

**Find ABE tasks in the To Do List**

When a source item is created or modified in ABE, one or more tasks (**Create**, **Update**, or **Delete**) appear in the To Do List. Because the To Do List may contain tasks for many items and documents, it is sometimes helpful to apply filters to reduce the number of tasks displayed and / or sort the tasks by ABE properties.

This procedure explains how to find ABE tasks using filtering and sorting by the ABE **Source Document** and **Source Tag** properties.

For general details about filtering tasks in the To Do List, see Filter To Do List Tasks.

For details about sorting tasks in the To Do List, see Sort To Do List Tasks.

1. Open the **To Do List** window.
2. On the toolbar, select **Filter / Sort Tasks**

.

1. Define your filter or sort criteria using either or both of the following properties: **Source Document** property. Example value for filtering: *P-100A/B: ABE Pump Process* *Specification (Design)*.

**Source Tag** property. Example value for filtering: *P-100A/B*.

You can also use the Search box to locate specific To Do List tasks. This feature displays tasks using search-as-you-type for all data columns. If a filter is already applied on the To Do List, the search is performed on the filtered view. For further details, see the description of the Search box in the topic To Do

List Dialog.

**Create equipment associated with an assembly from an ABE source**

1. Open the **To Do List** window.

1. From the **Catalog Item** window, select a folder with the assembly you want to associate, for example: **Assemblies** > **Equipment**.
2. From the lower pane, select an assembly.

Because the ABE tag is broken down to single items of a particular type, for example P-100A, representing a pump, you should choose an assembly with a *single* equipment as the catalog item because only *one* equipment in the assembly will receive the properties from ABE. If no

suitable assembly exists, you can create one yourself (for details, see Create an Assembly).

The symbol you select becomes the main item of the assembly for placement in the drawing and this item will receive the incoming properties from ABE when you run the task. The item type of the selected symbol also determines the EDE view under which the assembly will be available. For example, if the main item of the assembly is a pump, the assembly will appear under the EDE views **Equipment-Mechanica**l, **Equipment**, **Representation**, **Plant Item**, and **Matching Saved Views**. The item can be placed from all views except **Representation**.

1. If required, under the **Item Properties** section of the **Create** tab, select the **Ignore** check box beside any properties you want the software to ignore when running the task.

If you select the **Ignore** check box, the software ignores the property for the current and subsequent retrieve sessions unless the value of the property changes in the published data, in which case that property is no longer ignored the next time you retrieve the ABE data. To ignore a property for the current retrieve session only, clear both the **Activate** and **Ignore** check boxes beside the property.

1. Select **OK** to close the task **Properties** dialog.

When several **Create** tasks are generated from an ABE source item, the assembly selected for the first **Create** task is also selected for the other **Create** tasks of all related items.

1. Run the **Create** tasks for each related item you want to create in Smart P&ID.

The drawing must be active for the tasks to run. A **Create** task cannot be run for an inactive drawing.

A new **Create** task will replace any unexecuted related **Create** task in the To Do List.

For an ABE source item associated with an assembly, each item created is sent to the Active Drawing Stockpile (regardless of the toggle state of the To Do List **Create in Drawing** command), from

where it can be placed in the drawing. For details, see Working with ABE Items in the EDE.

**Graphical display**

All graphical elements of the assembly appear and only those symbols available for selection as the main assembly item are highlighted while the other elements of the assembly are grayed out. The symbol you select becomes the main item of the assembly for placement in the drawing and this item will receive the incoming properties from ABE when you run the task. The item type of the selected symbol also determines the EDE view under which the assembly will be available. For example, if the main item of the assembly is a pump, the assembly will appear under the EDE views **Equipment-Mechanica**l, **Equipment**, **Representation**, **Plant Item**, and **Matching Saved Views**. The item can be placed from all views except **Representation**.

**Propagation of ABE properties in an assembly**

In assemblies, the main item receives the properties from ABE. When you select this item in the EDE, the properties it received from ABE can be viewed in the EDE or in the **Properties** grid.

After placement, connected items such as nozzles, pipe runs, and so forth, will have the Smart P&ID

properties. If System Editing is turned on, the properties from ABE, except for **Source Tag**, are propagated to the connected items according to relationships and rules defined.

**Working with ABE Items in the EDE**

The assemblies or symbols created for the ABE items are sent to the Active Drawing Stockpile or placed outside the drawing frame in the active drawing. These can be viewed in the EDE by selecting any of the item type views under which they will be available. For example, if the created item is a Pump, it appears in the following EDE views:** Equipment: Mechanical, Equipment, Representation, Plant Item, **and** Matching Saved Views**. Therefore, you can select any of these views in the EDE to view the created items.

In the following example, the item type view is **Equipment** with the item type Pump as a symbol and also as an assembly.

The icon in the first column of the EDE grid indicates whether the created item is a symbol or an assembly:

— Pump as a symbol

— Pump as the main item of an assembly

Each of the created items has a **Source Tag** and an **Item Tag** property: The **Source Tag** is the ABE tag and is the same for all the related items.

The **Item Tag** is a unique tag generated for each related item when the **Create** task is executed.

The **Search**, **Filter** and **Sort** operations can be performed on ABE items in the same way as they are performed on other Smart P&ID items.

**Place items in the Design Window**

1. Select an item - symbol or assembly, in the EDE. This triggers selection of all the related items with the same Source Tag in the Active Drawing Stockpile and the Plant Stockpile.
2. In the Design Window, move the mouse pointer to where you want to place the item. The system displays handles before placement and a message appears with the following information: Sequence number of the current item being placed, along with its item tag.

Total number of available related items.

Consider four related items - P-100A, P-100B, P-100C and P-100D. If the system has already placed the first item P-100A, it displays the following message before placement of the second item P-100B:

*“Placing assembly 2 of 4 (P-100B)”*

The system displays handles and the message as mentioned in step 2 for all related items that it will place in the Design Window dynamically.

After an assembly is placed in the drawing, the system considers all items connected to the main item as individual components. Only the main item of the assembly will be associated with ABE through the Source Tag.

If, after placement, *at least one* assembly remains in one of the stockpiles, any new Create tasks generated in the To Do List for the source item will maintain their association with the assembly. If *all* the assemblies that share the same Source Tag are placed in the drawing or deleted from the stockpile, any new Create tasks generated will no longer be associated with the assembly but instead with the catalog item of the assembly main item (such as a pump). To associate a new Create task with the original assembly, you must select that assembly again manually.

You can let the placement of the items continue or you can cancel the operation and resume it when required.

If the selected item has related items in other drawings, the system places the items that are listed in the Active Drawing Stockpile and the Plant Stockpile.

You might not see all related items in the EDE when **Pagination**, **Filter** or **Search** criteria is applied, but when you select an item for placement, all related items in the Active Drawing Stockpile and the Plant Stockpile are dynamically placed in the drawing, whether they appear in the EDE or not.

**Cancel item placement**

You can cancel the dynamic placement of items either by right-clicking in the Design Window or by hitting the **Esc** key.

The items placed in the drawing will appear in the active drawing view in the EDE and rest of the items can be seen in the Active Drawing Stockpile or in the Plant Stockpile. The system automatically tracks the number of items already placed. When you start placing the items the next time, it shows the ordinal of the item being currently placed and the number of remaining items for placement in the respective stockpiles.

To resume the canceled operation, select the item again in the EDE.

**New properties in Smart P&ID**

For seamless integration and transfer of data from ABE to Smart P&ID, new process properties are added to the existing properties of the items. These properties begin with ‘Process’. For example ProcessOperating.Norm.Compressibility, ProcessOperating.Norm.FlowRate, ProcessOperating.Norm.FluidState, ProcessOperating.Norm.Pressure, and so forth.

**ABE Integration Example Scenarios**

The example scenarios in this section will be used to create the following detailed design: **Scenario 1**

Create 2 related equipment items (pumps) that will be assigned to an assembly https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

455/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Create 2 pipe runs for the inlet and outlet of one pump

**Scenario 2**

Update stream flow rate and pump capacity

Add one additional pump

**Scenario 3**

Delete the pump added in the previous scenario

**Scenario 1**

In this scenario, you will run tasks from the To Do List to do the following: Create pump assembly **P-101A** (sent to the Active Drawing Stockpile) Create pump assembly **P-101B** (sent to the Active Drawing Stockpile) Create pipe run **DEAFeed** (placed in the Design Window)

Create pipe run **GS9** (placed in the Design Window)

1. Display the **To Do List** dialog for imported ABE data (equipment and streams): 2. Assign a pump assembly to an equipment **Create** task.

**Integration with HxGN SDx2**

Integrating Smart P&ID’s Project items with HxGN SDx2 optimizes the efficiency of digital technology. One of the challenges an organization faces when making any kind of design change is how to maintain the accuracy of the essential information (design, planning, engineering, maintenance, and operations). This accuracy is vital for safe and efficient operations.

To standardize and improve the data exchange of Smart P&ID’s asset information, HxGN SDx2 uses a simplified Common Schema. This Common Schema enables all tools to communicate in a single schema format. HxGN SDx2 stores this digital asset information in a centralized location.

Smart P&ID facilitates the sharing of items along with their associated documents with HxGN SDx2 for communication among the various authoring tools. The data sharing process with HxGN SDx2 is data driven and scheduler based. Smart P&ID employs a new service that runs automatically in the background.

The service monitors incremental changes in its database on a scheduled basis and compares data to HxGN SDx2’s database. Setting up the automated sharing service is a one-time task. As you work on your project, the sharing happens seamlessly. Furthermore, any changes made to items since the last comparison are shared with HxGN SDx2 and can then be used by other authoring tools.

These capabilities enable changes to an existing plant while ensuring strict change control and providing operations access to current information for running the plant safely and efficiently.

**Prerequisites**

Integration with HxGN SDx2 includes two services that must be installed and configured: Intergraph Schematics Scheduler Service

Smart P&ID Share Service

**Smart P&ID Share Service and Intergraph Schematic Scheduler Service** **Overview**

The** Intergraph Schematic Scheduler Service** is a separate software utility that monitors changes to plant items. Once you setup and start the scheduler service, the service synchronizes the changes https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

461/984

with HxGN SDx2. Changes are then flagged for new, modified, or deleted plant items. Updates can then be shared with other Hexagon applications.

The **Intergraph Schematic Scheduler Service** needs to be configured using the **Schematic** **Scheduler Configuration Utility**. Before you setup a site using the **Configuration Utility**, make sure that **Smart P&ID Share Service** is installed.

The **Smart P&ID Share Service** enables integration with HxGN SDx2 and runs in the background. It is available with Smart P&ID as a separate feature and is located in the **Select Features to Install** section of the **Smart P&ID** installation DVD. You can also install the Share Service using the **Windows Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features**.

Here are the basic steps to setup and configure the services:

1. Ensure Smart P&ID Share Service is installed. See Install or modify Smart P&ID Select Features.
2. Install the Intergraph Schematic Scheduler.
3. Install Intergraph SmartPlant (.NET).
4. Configure the Intergraph Schematic Scheduler.
5. Start the Intergraph Schematic Scheduler Service.

The Smart P&ID Share Service, Intergraph Schematic Scheduler, and Intergraph SmartPlant (.NET) must be installed on the same workstation where Smart P&ID is installed.

To create enhanced mapping for integration, you must install Intergraph SmartPlant (COM) along with SmartPlant (.NET).

To use the Share Service with an Oracle client, you must install Oracle 64-bit client. The 64-bit Oracle client can coexist with the 32-bit client on the same host.

When an item is moved from the drawing to the plant stockpile and categorized under a plant group type - “Plant”, no relation will be established.

**Registering plants with HxGN SDx2**

Before you can share data between authoring tools and organizations using HxGN SDx2, you must register the plant in the authoring tool with the plant in HxGN SDx2. The relationship you create during this registration includes a tool signature or design component, which tracks where the data is coming from when shared. Each authoring tool can share with HxGN SDx2 and receive a unique tool signature. A new set of tables is created in the database as part of registration with the signature name. This allows HxGN

SDx2 to segregate data from different sources.

A system administrator typically configures the plant registration.

Depending on your organization’s policy and procedure, the plant and projects could have already been created in the HxGN SDx2 environment.

HxGN SDx2 supports SAM and Okta authentication.

The HxGN SDx2 login must have HxGN SDx2 **System Administration** and **Business Administrator** roles on the plant to which you are registering.

**Prerequisites**

Before registering Smart P&ID with HxGN SDx2, ensure that the following prerequisites are configured in HxGN SDx2.

1. Sign in to HxGN SDx2. Your system administrator typically provides the URL and sign-in credentials.
2. Ensure the user exists in HxGN SDx2 and belongs to the respective organization. See Update a user.
3. Ensure the user has at least **Business Administrator** and **System Administration** roles assigned.

See Assign roles to a user in a configuration.

1. Make sure the HxGN SDx2 project has a work area and work package.

Create a work area

Create a work package from work area

**Register a plant with HxGN SDx2**

1. Obtain the **Server Url** and **Client ID** from your HxGN SDx2 administrator.
2. Register the plant in Smart Engineering Manager. See Registering a plant with HxGN SDx2.

You must register each plant in Smart Engineering Manager once.

**Share data and documents with HxGN SDx2**

Smart P&ID can continuously share data and documents with HxGN SDx2 using the Schematic Scheduler Service. The sharing process occurs on a set schedule as configured in the Schematic Scheduler Service.

**Functional Considerations**

The Schematic Scheduler Service does not share a drawing if it is open in the Smart P&ID Modeler.

Share from projects is not supported.

The service does not support sharing duct runs and certain ducting components.

The service does not support sharing relations between the following item types and PBS items: https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

Pipe runs

Piping components

When an item is moved from a drawing to a stockpile, the system removes all its relationships with the PBS. HxGN SDx2 automatically assigns the item to a Work Area (WA).

**Reshare data and documents with HxGN SDx2**

Ensure the plant is registered with HxGN SDx2.

**Reshare plant items**

1. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, select **Push Plant Item** or **Push Plant Group** from the select list.
2. Select one or more items to reshare with HxGN SDx2.

In the **Reshare** column, notice that the status of selected items is **False**.

1. On the main menu, select **Integration** > Reshare.

*The software changes the **Reshare** status of the selected items to **True**. After the next sharing cycle* *completes, the **Last Publish Time** gets updated, and the **Reshare** status of the selected items* *changes back to **False**.*

**Reshare drawings**

1. In the **Engineering Data Editor**, add **Drawing Name** column to the view.
2. On the **SDx Class Def** column, select **Filter** , and then apply **[Empty]** data filter.
3. Select **Push Plant Item** or **Push Plant Group** from the select list.
4. Select one or more drawings to reshare with HxGN SDx2.

In the **Reshare** column, notice that the status of selected drawings is **False**.

1. On the main menu, select **Integration** > Reshare.

*The software changes the **Reshare** status of the selected drawings to **True**. After the next sharing* *cycle completes, the **Last Publish Time** gets updated, and the **Reshare** status of the selected* *drawings changes back to **False**.*

**What do True and False reshare statuses mean?**

**True** indicates that you have explicitly marked the item to be reshared with HxGN SDx2, overriding the default sharing behavior. All of the mapped properties of the item are pushed to HxGN SDx2 in the next sharing cycle, as configured in the Schematic Scheduler.

**False** indicates that the software determines if the item needs to be shared with HxGN SDx2, based on the default sharing behavior.

The **Start Publish Time** column is currently not supported.

**Reshare Command**

The **Integration** > **Reshare** command allows you to explicitly share P&ID items and drawings with HxGN

SDx2 in the next sharing cycle. By default, the software shares an item with HxGN SDx2 only if any of its properties have changed since it was last shared. However, it does not automatically share the newly mapped properties if their values have not changed.

This command is available only if the P&ID plant is registered with HxGN SDx2.

**Integration with SmartPlant Foundation**

Integration standardizes and improves the communication among the various authoring tools you use in the course of designing, constructing, and operating a plant. Integration manages data exchange among these authoring tools, which enables sharing and re-use of plant information throughout the plant life-cycle.

SmartPlant Foundation acts as a repository for data and a medium through which information is shared among other tools, such as Smart Instrumentation, Smart Electrical, and Smart 3D.

Most integration commands are available on the menu in Smart P&ID and Smart P&ID Drawing Manager.

The following graphic displays what Smart P&ID publishes and retrieves and shows the flow of data and the different types of data.

465/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Smart P&ID interacts with SmartPlant Foundation by correlating items between the plant database and the SmartPlant Foundation database by retrieving documents from SmartPlant Foundation. Also, Smart P&ID

creates a set of tasks in the To Do List that you can run to update the plant database. In Smart P&ID, you can also use the commands on the menu to publish documents and retrieve data, access SmartPlant Foundation to browse data, and subscribe to change notifications and compare documents.

You can only use the menu commands after your plant is registered. See Registering Tools.

**Tool Requirements for Integrating Smart P&ID**

This topic describes rules and settings that allow Smart P&ID data to be shared correctly with Aspen Basic Engineering, Smart Instrumentation, Smart 3D, and the other tools that are part of an integrated environment. Other tools that are not listed here have no known Smart P&ID/integration issues.

**General Integration Requirements**

The following is a list of *best practice* scenarios for using Smart P&ID so that data will migrate correctly to other tools:

In general, when modifying P&IDs that have been published, avoid unnecessarily deleting items in order to move them inside the active drawing or moving them to other drawings. Deleting and replacing items (with the same tag), causes additional work in applications retrieving the P&IDs that might negate the time-saving benefits of the P&ID changes.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

466/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

When working with Projects and As-Built, all instruments to be published must be placed on a P&ID

drawing or in the active drawing stockpile. This is because the plant stockpile is not communicated back and forth between Projects and As-Built.

To enable publishing from a project, you must create a project in SmartPlant Foundation with the same name (case-sensitive) as the P&ID project.

When creating symbols, connection points (piping, signal, and auxiliary) must be added in the correct sequence. See the Important note at the end of Place Point Ribbon (Smart P&ID) in Catalog Manager Help.

Signal points and piping points are not supported for Equipment and Equipment Components when publishing to SmartPlant Foundation.

When creating formats for use with Smart P&ID publishing, the formats must be added and mapped in SPPIDDataMap.xml using Schema Editor. The UID string of the custom SPMapUOMDef map file must be of the form *SPMU__* , where ‘NN’ represents the SPMapUOMListDef ID

for the format type (for example Temperature = 5; Pressure = 27). Because spaces or restricted characters are not allowed in the UID string, custom format names must not include spaces or restricted characters.

If you intend to publish select lists (enum lists) to SmartPlant Foundation, make sure that you review the SmartPlant Adapter for Smart P&ID Help to understand the requirements (see under *Data* *Transformation Logic* > *Publish/Retrieve*).

If the Smart P&ID item tag validation allows for duplicate tags, this might have an impact on downstream tools such as Smart Instrumentation, which does not allow duplicates. In such cases, allowing duplicates in Smart P&ID can cause problems in the retrieving tool.

By default, Smart P&ID item tag validation does not allow duplicate item tags for loops or instruments.

**Integration with Smart Instrumentation**

**Retrieving Documents**

If a Smart P&ID drawing that includes items with a flow direction is to be retrieved by Smart Instrumentation, a flow direction of **End 1 Upstream** or **End 1 Downstream** must be defined in Smart P&ID. Bi-directional flow is not supported.

**Connect to Process Lines**

**Connect to Process** lines are required for connecting instruments to equipment nozzles and pipe runs in Smart P&ID.

All non-piped offline equipment instruments must be connected to vessels through non-electric signal lines and nozzles in Smart P&ID. This enables Smart Instrumentation to recognize that instruments are https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

467/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

connected to vessels.

If Smart P&ID assigns an object to an intermediate level in the hierarchy and publishes, Smart Instrumentation assigns the object to the level in the hierarchy in Smart Instrumentation determined by their logic. Because instruments belong to units in Smart Instrumentation, an instrument assigned to the intermediate level in Smart P&ID will be assigned to the unit in Smart Instrumentation. Panels will be assigned to the plant. Smart P&ID might get an update on retrieve to move the object to another level in the hierarchy than where it was published based on the move done automatically by Smart Instrumentation.

Panels will move to the top level; instruments will move to the bottom.

**Deleting and Adding Items**

When you are working in a Projects environment, and items are correlated using the SmartPlant integration tools, you should minimize deleting and re-adding any items. Smart P&ID reuses tag numbers in the numbering scheme when you delete and re-add items. Smart Instrumentation tracks tag numbers claimed in a project, and this tracking does not work if tag numbers are reused after correlation. If you must delete an item in this situation, you can delete the item to the Smart P&ID Stockpile.

**Instrument Expansion**

A Smart P&ID instrument or loop tag does not always have a 1:1 relationship with instruments in Smart Instrumentation. In some cases, a single item tag in a P&ID corresponding to an instrument or loop needs to be expanded to create several instruments when publishing the data for Smart Instrumentation. For this purpose, the **Expansion Type** property in Smart P&ID specifies the expansion behavior when publishing an instrument or loop. Each value of the property corresponds to a Smart Instrumentation rule that determines which instrument types and numbers are to be created in Smart Instrumentation when the Smart P&ID tag is expanded and retrieved.

When retrieving data back to Smart P&ID, the behavior of a particular instrument created by expansion is determined by Smart Instrumentation parameters. For an expanded instrument, the state of the IRetrievableExpansion interface determines whether that instrument will be retrieved by Smart P&ID: if the IRetrievableExpansion interface is realized, the instrument is retrieved, whereas if the IRetrievableExpansion interface is *not* realized, the instrument is not retrieved. The ‘parent’ item tag is *always* retrieved, regardless of the realization state of the IRetrievableExpansion interface.

**Ports**

Smart Instrumentation uses physical ports, while Smart P&ID uses logical ports. Smart Instrumentation publishes the physical ports with the Dimensional Data Sheets and not the Instrument Index. Smart P&ID

retrieves the Instrument Index and does not retrieve the Dimensional Data Sheets.

When the workflow goes from Smart P&ID to Smart Instrumentation, followed by Smart Instrumentation publishing the Dimensional Datasheet, a Same As relationship is created between the ports in the SmartPlant Foundation database. That Same As relationship is required by Smart 3D to correctly match the design basis ports to the 3D representation of the ports.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

468/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

However, when the workflow goes from Smart Instrumentation to Smart P&ID, a Same As relationship is not created in the SmartPlant Foundation database. Without the Same As relationship created in the SmartPlant Foundation database, the result might be additional ports in Smart 3D. To obtain the Same As relationship on the ports requires that Smart P&ID publish the P&ID with the instrument, this P&ID be retrieved by Smart Instrumentation and then having Smart Instrumentation publish the Dimensional Data Sheet.

**Integration with Smart 3D**

**General**

In Options Manager, ensure that under **Settings**, the **Use Piping Specification** setting value is **Smart 3D**

even if the P&ID plant is not validating piping specifications. This is to ensure that the required Piping Component Select List entries are properly set to match the PIP short codes expected by Smart 3D. See *Configure Piping Specification Settings* in Smart P&ID * * Options Manager User’s Help.

**Drawing Items**

For Smart 3D to properly determine flow direction in a process run, that process run must be connected to at least 2 items.

Some items that can be represented as single objects in Smart P&ID, such as Vent Detail, are modeled in Smart 3D as a set of separate objects. For full correlation to be established between the two tools, ensure that these objects are modeled in Smart P&ID with the same configuration used to represent them in Smart 3D.

**Properties**

Smart 3D handles temperature and pressure properties in pairs and does not support having a temperature (for example, Normal Operating Temperature) without defining the matching pressure (in this case, Normal Operating Pressure). While this is a valid condition for Smart P&ID, it should be a consideration when publishing for retrieval into Smart 3D. Without the Pressure / Temperature pair of values defined, the Smart 3D user will be required to enter a value that was not defined in Smart P&ID.

**Integration with Aspen Basic Engineering**

**Retrieving Documents**

Basic Engineering data sheets can contain multiple objects and can be formatted in a traditional data sheet view or list view (for example, as an equipment list). Data sheets retrieved from Basic Engineering might include stream data, specialty piping data, or relief valve data as required by business practices.

**Using the Catalog Index in Smart P&ID and SmartPlant Integration** When you select the **Retrieve** command, the software accesses the CatalogIndex.mdb and the system performs the following actions:

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

469/984

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

1. Using the retrieved document, the object type and classification of the retrieved item is determined.
2. Using the Smart P&ID Map file, the ItemTypeName (Equipment, PipeRun, PipingComp, Loops, and so forth), and codelist indices for Class, Sub-Class, and Type are determined.

**Catalog Index Lookup**

The Catalog Index file is used to find a symbol in the catalog with type properties that match the given values. The lookup is performed using the most specific information first. If a match is found, that symbol is used. However, if there is no match, the more generic type information is used for additional searches. In this way, a generic symbol will be returned if no specific symbol is available in the catalog.

**Search Based on Type Value**

Searches the catalog index for all rows with matching ItemTypeName and Type values and IsDefaultForType = True. If one or more rows are found, the software uses the CatalogItemName from the first one. If no match is found, the software performs the search based on Subclass.

**Search Based on Subclass Value**

Searches the catalog index for all rows with matching ItemTypeName and SubClass values and IsDefaultForSubclass = True. If one or more rows are found, the software uses the CatalogItemName from the first one. If no match is found, the software performs the search based on Class.

**Search Based on Class Value**

Searches the catalog index for all rows with matching ItemTypeName and Class values and IsDefaultForClass = True. If one or more rows are found, the software uses the CatalogItemName from the first one. If no match is found, the software returns an empty string.

**Macro Expansion Typical Work Process**

This topic describes a typical work process for implementing macro expansion in an integrated environment.

**The SmartPlant Adapter and Tool Schema**

To create enhanced mapping for integration, you must install Intergraph SmartPlant (COM) and Intergraph SmartPlant (.NET).

The tool schema implements a mapping between the objects in the Smart P&ID data model and the objects in SmartPlant schema. If you customize either the Smart P&ID data model or the SmartPlant schema, you may also need to customize the mapping contained in the tool schema. The following describes the structure of the tool schema and how it is used by the Smart P&ID adapter in order to support the publish and retrieve functions.

**Publish**

When a P&ID drawing is published, the Adapter extracts data from the Smart P&ID database and converts it into a set of objects and relationships that are compatible with the SmartPlant schema. These objects and relationships are written out to an XML file and are sent to the SmartPlant Server for further processing. The adapter depends on the data in the tool schema to support the publish operation.

For each published class in the tool schema, there is a code module in the adapter known as a Class Publisher. The Class Publisher contains code for the following tasks: **Query the P&ID Database** — The Class Publisher queries the database to obtain the collection of items to be published.

**Create a Data Object** — For each item to be published, the Class Publisher creates a data object in the document container. The class of this object is the SmartPlant schema class related to the MapClass via the MapClassToClass relationship.

**Set the Property Values** — The property values on the data object are set according to the values on the Smart P&ID item. The list of properties to be published is defined by the list of MapProperties related to the current MapClass.

**Publish Relationships** — The Class Publisher defines the types of relationships that are to be published for each data object it publishes.

**Retrieve**

When a document from another authoring tool is retrieved, the adapter compares the objects in that document to the data in the Smart P&ID database and generates tasks in the To Do List. A Create task is generated when a new item needs to be created. An Update task is generated when an existing item needs to be modified. A Delete task is generated when an existing item needs to be deleted. The adapter depends on the data in the tool schema to support the retrieve operation.

Generation of Create, Update, and Delete tasks can, if required, be suppressed for specified document types, for example, for objects that are not correlated between the publishing and retrieving tools.

For details of how to do this, see Suppress Generation of Tasks on Retrieve.

For each retrieved class in the tool schema, there is a code module in the adapter known as a Class Retriever. Each Class Retriever contains code for retrieving a class of objects.

When a document is retrieved, the adapter receives two containers of data.

1. The document container includes all of the published objects and relationships for that document.
2. The tombstone container includes information about deleted objects and relationships.

The adapter iterates over all of the objects in the document container and performs these actions: **Use Identifying Interface to Determine Class** — The incoming object is tested for an identifying interface to determine which Class Retriever should handle the retrieval of that object.

**Generate Update Task** — The Class Retriever searches for an existing Smart P&ID item to update. If an item is found, it generates an Update task in the To Do List. The properties of the incoming object are compared against the properties of the existing item. When differences are found, property updates are added to the task. The list of properties to be compared is defined by the properties in the tool schema.

**Generate Create Task** — If no item is found to update, a Create task is generated in the To Do List.

Property updates are added to the task for each of the incoming property values. The list of properties to be added is defined by the properties in the tool schema.

**Retrieve Relationships** — The Class Retriever defines the types of relationships that are to be retrieved for each data object.

The adapter iterates over all of the objects in the tombstone container and performs these actions: **Generate Delete Task** — The adapter searches for an existing item in the Smart P&ID database that is correlated to the item that was deleted in the other application. If such an item is found, a Delete task is generated in the To Do List.

**Smart P&ID Mapping Rules and Limitations**

For properties that use enumerated lists to publish, you must add EFAdapter.EnumConversions to the process criteria when you define the map property definition in the tool schema.

When you create a new enumerated list definition in the tool map file, you must replace the system-generated UID for the list with SP_<Codelist_Index>, for example, SP_12001. The codelist index is located in the Enumerations database table for the Smart P&ID Data Dictionary user in the Smart P&ID database.

When you create enumerated list entries in the tool map file, you must replace the system-generated UID for each list entry with SP_<Codelist_Index>_<Codelist_Number>, for example, SP_12001_1.

The codelist index for the enumerated list and the codelist number for the entry are located in the https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

Enumerations and Codelists database table for the Smart P&ID Data Dictionary user in the Smart P&ID database.

If you want Smart P&ID to create line numbers at publish time so that they match the displayed labels on the P&ID, you can modify the process criteria for the ItemTag map property definition in the publish map for the PipeRun tool class. To change the format for line numbers, modify the process criteria for the ItemTag, and add the properties that you want to include in the item tag inside angle brackets (<>) after EFAdapter.PpConnNameConv. For example, EFAdapter.PpConnNameConv, -

- . The property names inside the angle brackets must match property names in the map file.

If you want Smart P&ID to create the Pipe Run name at publish time so that it matches the ItemTag value in the Smart P&ID **Properties** window, you can remove the special adapter method seen in the map file (as delivered it appears as EFAdapter.PpConnNameConv, -

- ). This prevents the software from performing name conversion when generating the Pipe Run name.

You can specify for Smart P&ID to create the Pipe Run name at publish time so that it displays any pipe run properties that you require. To do this, you add the properties that you want to include in the item tag inside angle brackets (<>) after EFAdapter.PpConnNameConv. However, note that the name conversion supports only those properties that belong to the Pipe Run.

To ensure that data is published for the pipe ScheduleOrThickness property, you must specify the data so that it matches the entries in the ‘Schedule or Thickness Standards’ Enumeration list under the SmartPlant Foundation schema.

**Tool Schema Location**

The Smart P&ID tool schema is named SPPIDDataMap.xml. This file must exist in the folder specified by the SmartPlant ResourcePath setting in Options Manager. When a new plant is created, you must define the value of this setting and ensure that the file exists in that folder. During publish and retrieve operations, the adapter looks for that file in that location.

**The Tool Schema Data Model**

The following graphic displays a representation of the objects and relationships that are relevant to the Smart P&ID tool schema.

The rectangles on the left side of the graphic represent objects in the tool schema. The rectangles on the right represent objects in the SmartPlant schema. The relationships that connect objects on the left with objects on the right are the mapping relationships. The map file contains both the tool schema objects and the mapping relationships.

**MapClass**

The MapClass object corresponds to the IMapClassDef interface in the Mapping Relationships diagram. In general, there is a MapClass object in the tool schema for each Smart P&ID class (ItemType) that needs to be published or retrieved. MapClass is referred to as SPMapClassDef in the Schema Editor.

property conversion module is

specifically targeted to handle

conversion of attributes without

units (such as Molecular

these attributes are treated like

UoM attributes. However, in the

SmartPlant schema they are

simply Double.

UoMToEnumConv

This class implements the

property conversion code

between UoM to Enumerated

List.

**Hierarchical Enumerated Lists**

A hierarchical enumerated list is a complex data type in which there is a collection of related enumerated lists and a value in a higher level list constrains the valid values in a lower level list. When a hierarchical enumerated list is used, a separate property is created for each level in the hierarchy.

490/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Examples of hierarchical enumerated lists in Smart P&ID are Equipment Class, Equipment Subclass, Equipment Type, and Fluid System, Fluid Code. Examples in the SmartPlant schema include: EqType0, … , EqType6, and ConstructionStatus, ConstructionStatus2.

When mapping between Smart P&ID and the SmartPlant schema, four cases must be considered.

1. Simple enumerated list to simple enumerated list.
2. Simple enumerated list to hierarchical enumerated list.
3. Hierarchical enumerated list to simple enumerated list.
4. Hierarchical enumerated list to hierarchical enumerated list. When mapping between two hierarchical enumerated lists, the number of levels in each hierarchy might not be the same.

**EnumConversions**

A special Property Conversion class is available to support publishing and retrieving of enumerated properties. This class is called EnumConversions, and it is used for all cases of mapping enumerated list properties.

**Mapping Properties**

Only the top level properties associated with a hierarchical enumerated list are mapped. The lower level properties are left unmapped. The EnumConversions object obtains all of the values from the set of related properties even though they are not explicitly mapped.

**Tool Schema Relationships**

The MapEnumList objects that form an enumerated hierarchy must be related to each other with the Constrains and Constrained By relationships. The EnumConversions object relies on these relationships to get the job done.

**Mapping Enum Values**

An enumerated value within an enumerated list hierarchy can be mapped to any value (at any level) in the target enumerated list hierarchy. There is no explicit relationship between the levels of two hierarchies.

**Catalog Index**

During retrieval of a document, when a create task is generated, the adapter must select a symbol to be used by the task. The adapter uses the Catalog Index to quickly find a suitable symbol to be used. The Catalog Index lookup is based on the *type* properties. For example, when generating a create task for Equipment, the Equipment Class/Subclass/Type properties are used to perform the lookup. Before the Catalog Index lookup can take place, the incoming SmartPlant type values must be converted into Smart P&ID type values. This conversion of a SmartPlant schema enum value into a Smart P&ID enumerated https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

value is performed by the EnumConversions object just like any other enumerated property value. It depends on the mapping of enumerated values found in the tool schema.

**Drawing**

There is a MapClass in the tool schema for Drawing. The MapProperties for this MapClass define the properties that will be published from the Smart P&ID Drawing item to the SmartPlant schema PIDDrawing object. If new properties are added to the Drawing item type in the Data Dictionary Manager, and corresponding new properties are added in the SmartPlant schema, then they can be mapped by adding new MapProperties to this MapClass in the tool schema using the Schema Editor.

**Equipment**

In Smart P&ID there is an abstract class for Equipment with four subclasses for Vessel, Exchanger, Mechanical and OtherEquipment. In the SmartPlant schema, there are four PID equipment classes.

1. PIDProcessVessel
2. PIDHeatTransferEquipment
3. PIDMechanicalEquipment

## 4. PIDProcessEquipment

The tool schema has a MapClass for each of the four equipment subclasses in Smart P&ID and another MapClass for the abstract Equipment class.

**Publish**

The four MapClasses map the corresponding equipment classes in Smart P&ID and the SmartPlant schema. A Smart P&ID vessel is published as a PIDProcessVessel in SmartPlant; an Exchanger is published as a PIDHeatTransferEquipment, and so forth. The MapClass for Equipment does not play any role in the publish operation.

**Retrieve**

When a document is being retrieved, each incoming object is tested for identifying interfaces to determine what type of object it is. The object is first tested for the identifying interfaces for Vessel, Exchanger, Mechanical and OtherEquipment. If the object has one of these identifying interfaces, it is retrieved as that specific type of equipment (using the MapProperties associated with the specific MapClass for that equipment class in the tool schema). If the object is not recognized by its interfaces as any of these specific equipment types, but it is recognized as Equipment, it is retrieved as generic equipment (using the MapProperties associated with the generic Equipment MapClass in the tool schema).

In the SmartPlant schema, there are three PID instrument classes.

PIDInstrument

PIDInlineInstrument

PIDControlSystemFunction

The tool schema has three MapClasses.

Instrument

InstrumentInline

InstrumentCtrlSysFunc

The Smart P&ID adapter has three separate Class Publisher/Retriever objects for these three classes.

**Publish**

All Smart P&ID instruments with Instrument Class equal to System Function are published as PIDControlSystemFunction using the InstrumentCtrlSysFunc MapClass. All Smart P&ID instruments with IsInline equal to True are published as PIDInlineInstrument using the InstrumentInline MapClass. All other Smart P&ID instruments are published as PIDInstrument using the Instrument MapClass.

All objects that have the IControlSystemFunction interface are retrieved as Instruments using the InstrumentCtrlSysFunc MapClass. All objects that have the IInstrumentOcc interface are retrieved as Instruments using the PIDInlineInstrument MapClass.

The **InstrLoop** map class in the tool schema is used for the instrument loop, which is usually retrieved when retrieving the associated instruments. To retrieve instruments from Smart Instrumentation without their associated loops, for the **InstrLoop** map class **Process Criteria** property, change the string

‘EFAdapter.InstrLoopDataExchanger,False,7’ to ‘EFAdapter.InstrLoopDataExchanger,False,7**,False**’ (add an

extra ‘False’ parameter with a comma separator at the end). For more details, see MapClass.

**PipeRun**

In Smart P&ID there is a single class for PipeRun. This class has properties describing aspects of the physical pipe and other properties that describe the fluid flowing through that pipe. In the SmartPlant schema there are two relevant classes: PIDPipingConnector for the pipe itself and PIDProcessPoint for the process data. Furthermore, the SmartPlant schema has several classes that are used to publish a stream and its associated process data on a PFD. The Smart P&ID tool schema has one MapClass for PipeRun.

**Publish**

Each Smart P&ID PipeRun is published as a PIDPipingConnector and a PIDProcessPoint with a relationship between the two. Some of the properties from the PipeRun are mapped to the PIDPipingConnector and others are mapped to the PIDProcessPoint.

**Retrieve**

When an object is retrieved with the IPipingSystemConnector interface, it is recognized as a Stream and is retrieved using the PipeRun MapClass to create or update a PipeRun. The ProcessDataCaseComposition relationship is traversed to obtain objects that realize the IProcessDataCase interface. From those objects, the ProcessDataBulkComposition relationship is traversed to obtain objects that realize the IProcessDataBulkPhase interface. Properties from all of these SmartPlant schema objects can be retrieved onto the Smart P&ID PipeRun object.

**Select Criteria**

In the Schema Editor, the **Select Criteria** option on the MapProperty is used to indicate to the adapter how to handle each property for both publish and retrieve. The format of the **Select Criteria** option is: **Select** **Criteria** = %

Indicates where the property comes from during retrieve. If this value is empty, it means that the property comes from the primary object being retrieved (IPipingSystemConnector). If a value exists, it means that this property comes from one of the secondary objects that is related to the primary object by means of a relationship.

This is a string that indicates where the property goes during publish. If this value is empty, it means that the property is published to the primary object (PIDPipingConnector). If this property is has a value (it should be equal to ProcessPoint), it means that this property is published to the related PIDProcessPoint object.

**PipeLine**

In Smart P&ID, graphical pipe runs indicate the schematic piping design. You can assign naming properties to these pipe runs. All of the pipe runs with matching values for the naming properties form a logical group.

Such a group is sometimes called a pipeline and the values of the naming properties represent the name of the pipeline. All of this is done without requiring you to explicitly create a pipeline object.

In the SmartPlant schema there is an explicit PIDPipeLine class. Objects of this class must be published with relationships to the associated PIDPipingConnectors. Some downstream applications depend on the existence of the PIDPipeLine for their processing.

The Smart P&ID adapter creates and deletes pipelines dynamically during the publish operation. The pipelines and the relationships to the pipe runs are published as if they really existed in the Smart P&ID

database. The tool schema contains a MapClass for PipeLine. The MapProperties for the pipeline MapClass define the properties that are published to the PIDPipeline object.

**Special Smart P&ID Mapping Procedures**

The procedures in this section explain how to specify whether particular items or relationships are to be included in or omitted from publish or retrieve actions.

Publish with Instrument Expansion

Retrieve Expanded Instruments

Define Mapping Relationships as ‘For Documentation Only’

Publish the ‘OwnsComponentOcc’ Relation

**Publish with Instrument Expansion**

You can enable the expansion of a single published instrument from Smart P&ID into a set of instruments in Smart Instrumentation (including the original instrument).

Instrument expansion is executed in Smart Instrumentation in accordance with the particular expansion type selected by the user in Smart P&ID.

To enable data exchange with SmartPlant Foundation and other tools, the schema version in use must include the following Interfaces:

**Retrieve Expanded Instruments**

When retrieving an instrument, any number of instruments that were generated by expansion (from none to all of the expanded instruments) can also be retrieved. The actual number of expanded instruments that are retrieved is determined by rules implemented in Smart Instrumentation.

To enable data exchange with SmartPlant Foundation and other tools, the schema version in use must include the following Interfaces:

The IExpandableThing.ExpansionType Interface holds the expansion rules list. IExpandableThing is only realized for expanded instruments, but not for the original instrument. The original instrument is always retrieved.

The IRetrievableExpansion Interface determines whether the item is to be retrieved by Smart P&ID.

The following table summarizes how the realization of these interfaces determines whether or not an instrument is retrieved.

**Define Mapping Relationships as ‘For Documentation Only’**

MapPropertyToProperty or PropertyToMapProperty relationships that are set to ‘for documentation only’ are included in tool schema mapping to show that mapping relationships exist between the map property and the property definitions but that the support for these mapping relationships is hard-coded (and is therefore only included in the mapping for documentation purposes).

Set ‘for documentation only’ mapping relationships as follows:

1. In Schema Editor, open the **Edit Map Class Definition** dialog.
2. Select the **Publish** or **Retrieve** tab.

The ‘for documentation only’ mapping relationships appear as dashed arrows (instead of solid arrows which indicate standard mapping relationships).

1. To change the setting, select the rows from the bottom pane, and select an arrow in the **Map Type** column.
2. On the dialog that opens, toggle the **For documentation only?**  value between **True** and **False** as needed.

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

If you set a value to **True**, the application adapter ignores the mapping relationship and uses hard-coded logic which should already be defined.

**Publish the ‘OwnsComponentOcc’ Relation**

OwnsComponentOcc is a relation between a pipe run and piping component that is used to determine which pipe segment the piping component is related to. To include this relation when publishing, the user must update the map file as described below.

1. Open the Tool schema in the Schema Editor.
2. Open the SPPIDDataMap.xml on the **Tool Schema** tab.
3. Under the **SPMapRelDef** node, right-click **OwnsComponentOcc** and on the shortcut menu, select **Edit OwnsComponentOcc**.
4. On the **Edit Map Relationship Definition** dialog, beside **Maps to**, select the ellipsis button and

from the list of EFSchema RelDef items, select **OwnsComponentOcc**.

**Suppress Generation of Tasks on Retrieve**

When retrieving documents in Smart P&ID, it is possible to suppress the generation of Create, Update, or Delete tasks for specified document types by adding code in the **Select criteria** field for the appropriate MapClass object (SPMapClassDef).

To ensure the maintenance of data integrity in other tools, after you have made the definitions in a particular MapClass object for suppressing the generation of tasks and you subsequently publish drawings, do not change or remove those definitions during the course of the integrated project.

1. Open the Tool schema in the Schema Editor.
2. Open the SPPIDDataMap.xml on the **Tool Schema** tab.
3. Expand the** SPMapClassDef **node.
4. Scroll down to the **PipeRun** map class and right-click the node.

A special DocType called “Deleted and Unclaimed Objects” can be published by applications.

This DocType contains published objects which were moved and then later deleted – for example, all objects in the Instrument Index in Smart Instrumentation could be published once and then subsequently published with a filter applied. The software now identifies those objects excluded by the filter as moved (unclaimed). If you then delete any of those unclaimed objects and publish again, the objects will appear in the “Deleted and Unclaimed Objects” DocType. To ensure that “Deleted and Unclaimed Objects” are included when suppressing the generation of Delete tasks, you should include in the **Select criteria** field “Deleted and Unclaimed Objects”, with the understanding that this document will be retrieved automatically from all applications when necessary.

**Code Syntax**

Use the following code syntax for suppressing task generation:

NoDeleteTasksForDocTypes=[DocType1;DocType2;…;DocTypeN]/NoCreateTasksForDocTypes=

[DocType1;DocType2;…;DocTypeN]/NoUpdateTasksForDocTypes=[DocType1;DocType2;…;DocTypeN]

where the code elements are as follows:

**NoDeleteTasksForDocTypes** suppresses generation of Delete tasks for the specified document types.

**NoCreateTasksForDocTypes** suppresses generation of Create tasks for the specified document types.

**NoUpdateTasksForDocTypes** suppresses generation of Update tasks for the specified document types.

A forward slash (/) separates the commands for each task type (Delete, Create, Update).

For each task type, the document type names or IDs are separated by a semicolon (;) as shown: In this example, EE82 is the ID for PFD documents, and EE84 is the ID for Instrument Index documents.

To find the name or ID of a document type, go to the retrieved document and use the ‘DocType’

property value of the **IDocument** interface.

**Code Example**

The following code is used to suppress generation of Create and Delete tasks for PFD and Instrument Index documents (using document type names and IDs) including Delete tasks for deleted and unclaimed objects: NoCreateTasksForDocTypes=PFD;EE82;Instrument

Index;EE84/NoDeleteTasksForDocTypes=PFD;EE82;Instrument Index;EE84;Deleted and Unclaimed Objects

By default, changes to the SmartPlant Schema are written to all versions managed by the CMF file.

Although you can choose to write changes to only selected versions, we do not recommend doing so.

If you choose to view one version of the schema (**Specify configurations to display** window) but write changes to all versions (**Set Configurations for new objects** window), an information window appears when you select **OK**, indicating that you will be prompted with every change to the schema to confirm that you want to write the changes to all versions. Select **OK** to continue.

3. In each row in the **Synchronize** dialog, the values in the tool database and tool map schema columns indicate actions to correct inconsistencies between the tool metadata and tool map schema. Select the appropriate action in each row, and then select **OK**.

Each row represents a discrepancy between the tool database and the tool map schema.

Default actions are blue when the **Synchronize** dialog displays. However, if you select a different option, it will become blue instead.

In many cases, only one operation is supported to synchronize the tool database and tool map schema. For example, if a new property was found in the database, the metadata adapter can add the property to the tool map schema, but it cannot remove the property from the tool database.

definition to make sure that it is realized by the PIDInstrumentLoop class definition and implied by the IInstrumentLoop interface.

The view definition that creates the list of unmapped properties is generated by the software the first time you access the **Edit** form for a map class for each Schema Editor session. So, if you view the list, leave it, and make changes, such as adding additional interfaces to the class definition to which the map class is mapped, the changes you made will not appear when you return to this form because the view definition is not updated or regenerated. You will see the changes during your next Schema Editor session.

**Map the SystemCode Property for Additional Map Class Definitions** Because multiple Smart P&ID classes inherited the SystemCode property, you can create additional mapping so that other objects can publish the property.

1. In the **Map Environment** tree view, right-click **Instrument**, and then select **Edit Instrument** on the shortcut menu.
2. Select the **Publish** tab.
3. Under **Unmapped application properties**, select **SystemCode**.
4. Under **Unmapped SmartPlant properties**, select **SystemCode**.
5. On the toolbar, select **Map**

.

1. Repeat steps 1-5 in this section to map the SystemCode property for any Smart P&ID map class definitions that represent objects for which you want to publish this property.

To create a retrieve mapping relationship for a property, follow the same steps on the **Retrieve** tab.

**Save the Tool Map Schema and SmartPlant Schema Changes**

Select **File** > **Save** **All Modified Files** to save the SmartPlant schema changes (CMF file) and the tool map schema.

When you close the Schema Editor, the software prompts you to save your connection information, user interface options, and loaded tool map schemas to a session file. Select **Yes** in the message box to save the session file so that you can use it to return to this working environment. However, you should not open a session file after launching the CMF file from the Desktop Client.

If you save changes to the CMF file or a tool map schema but did not validate the changes before exiting, the software displays an information message to remind you that the file contains changes that have not been validated. Select **OK** to dismiss the message.

If you make changes to the SmartPlant schema, you must load the changes into the SmartPlant Foundation database.

definition to make sure that it is realized by the PIDInstrumentLoop class definition and implied by the IInstrumentLoop interface.

The view definition that creates the list of unmapped properties is generated by the software the first time you access the **Edit** form for a map class for each Schema Editor session. So, if you view the list, leave it, and make changes, such as adding additional interfaces to the class definition to which the map class is mapped, the changes you made will not appear when you return to this form because the view definition is not updated or regenerated. You will see the changes during your next Schema Editor session.

**Map the EngSys Property for Additional Map Class Definitions**

Because multiple Smart P&ID classes inherited the EngSystem property, you can create additional mapping so that other objects can publish the property.

1. In the tree view, right-click **Instrument**, and then select **Edit Instrument** on the shortcut menu.
2. Select the **Publish** tab.
3. Under **Unmapped application properties**, select **EngSystem**.
4. Under **Unmapped SmartPlant properties**, select **EngineeringSys**.
5. On the toolbar, select **Map**

.

1. Repeat steps 1-5 in this section to map the **EngSys** property for all Smart P&ID map class definitions that represent objects for which you want to publish this property.

To create a retrieve mapping relationship for a property, follow the same steps on the **Retrieve** tab.

**Save the Tool Map Schema and SmartPlant Schema Changes**

Select **File** > **Save** **All Modified Files** to save the SmartPlant schema changes (CMF file) and the tool map schema.

When you close the Schema Editor, the software prompts you to save your connection information, user interface options, and loaded tool map schemas to a session file. Select **Yes** in the message box to save the session file so that you can use it to return to this working environment. However, you should not open a session file after launching the CMF file from the Desktop Client.

If you save changes to the CMF file or a tool map schema but did not validate the changes before exiting, the software displays an information message to remind you that the file contains changes that have not been validated. Select **OK** to dismiss the message.

If you make changes to the SmartPlant schema, you must load the changes into the SmartPlant Foundation database.

Additionally, if you made changes to the SmartPlant schema, you should regenerate the component schemas for the site before testing any publish or retrieve mapping relationships.

**Smart P&ID Example: Mapping Equipment Classes to Publish Process** **Data**

The following mapping example describes how to map process data for the four Equipment classes: Equipment Other, Exchanger, Mechanical, and Vessel. The following example explains how to map process data for the Vessel class. However, a similar procedure applies to all the Equipment classes listed above.

The following must exist in the PIDComponent schema:

IProcessPoint and IProcessDataCaseComposition are realized by PIDProcessVessel, PIDMechanicalEquipment, PIDProcessEquipment, and PIDHeatTransferEquipment.

IProcessDataCaseComposition is implied by IPIDMechanicalEquipmentOcc, IPIDProcessVesselOcc, IPIDHeatTransferEquipmentOcc, and IEquipmentOcc.

PIDProcessVessel, PIDMechanicalEquipment, PIDProcessEquipment, and

PIDHeatTransferEquipment must realize the interface that exposes the SmartPlant property definitions to which you want to map. For example, in this topic, you will map ProcessOperatingMaxTemperature** **to PhaseTemperatureMax, which is exposed by IBulkMaxProcessPoint. To map a ProcessOperatingMaxTemperature property to PhaseTemperatureMin, the class definition should realize IBulkMinProcessPoint.

**Before You Extend the Smart P&ID Database**

1. Make a backup of the SmartPlant Foundation site database and any vaults for the site.
2. Create a backup of Smart P&ID, including a database backup from the plant level with reference data, an application-level data dictionary template (DDT), and a backup of the SPPIDDataMap.xml file located in the SmartPlant resources directory.

**Launch the Schema Editor and Load the Smart P&ID Tool Map Schema** 1. In the Desktop Client, set your scope for the applicable plant, and then find the CMF file.

1. Right-click the CMF file, and select **Launch Schema Editor**.

This method is called by SmartPlant Client and needs to be implemented to modify, add, or remove information from the data to be published before transmitting to SmartPlant Foundation. This implementation can also validate the published data and raise messages during the publish process. It can also update the publish progress bar with the status of each step.

By implementing this method, you can achieve the following:

Modify or add information to the published data that cannot be handled by the tool adapters.

Filter and limit information from the data being published.

Calculate additional information based on the publishing application data, such as finding the beginning P&ID number for a pipeline.

Manipulate data to represent special business rules.

Validate data and raise an “invalid” state to EFClient to stop the publish process.

To log messages, make sure *MessageIContainer* is set, and add the messages to *MessageIContainer*. The messages are saved to a log file.

To display progress steps in the publish progress bar, implement *ListOfProgressSteps()*. For each step, call *StepProgressBegin(stepName)* before and *StepProgressEnd(stepName)* after. Use the member variable of type *IEFCustomPublishEventHandler* with *SetEventHandlerObj()*.

**Accessing the SmartPlant Foundation Web Client**

The SmartPlant Foundation Web Client provides a web-based user interface that allows you to interact with SmartPlant Foundation. From this interface you can perform a number of tasks, such as browse data and documents that have been published, use the SmartPlant Foundation To Do List to complete workflow tasks, compare document revisions and published documents with tool data, and subscribe to documents to receive notification of document changes.

**Access the SmartPlant Foundation Web Client**

In the authoring tool, select **Integration** > Browser.

This command is available only if you have registered the active plant using the SmartPlant Registration Wizard. See Smart Engineering Manager help.

From the SmartPlant Foundation Web Client, you can perform a number of tasks, such as publishing or retrieving documents, comparing documents, subscribing to document changes, and so forth. Many of these tasks can be performed from the authoring tools, such as Smart P&ID or Smart Electrical, but the Web Client provides unique access to other features such as the Web Client To Do List and search capabilities.

**Browser Command**

Opens the SmartPlant Foundation Web Client, from which you can perform a number of tasks, such as browsing for documents that have been published, using the SmartPlant Foundation To Do List to complete tasks, comparing documents in the SmartPlant Foundation database with the data in your authoring tool, and subscribing to documents to receive notification of changes to the documents.

This command is available only if you have registered the active plant using the SmartPlant Registration Wizard.

**Revising Documents**

The software implements drawing revisions in different ways depending on your work environment. If you are working in an integrated environment, when you select the **Revisions** > **New Revision** command in Drawing Manager, the software opens either the SmartPlant Foundation **Revise** dialog or the **New** **Revision** dialog, depending on the option selected in Options Manager for the **Revision Management** **Software for Publishing Documents** setting. If you want to associate a version with a new revision in an integrated environment, you must select the drawing and run the **Revisions** > ** Associate Version** command in Drawing Manager after creating the revision.

The document revision process is separate from the publishing process, making it possible to revise a document locally and in SmartPlant Foundation and save the revision values to the tool database without re-publishing the document.

Revising a document creates a revision for the document with major and minor revision values set, depending on the revision schema selected. When revising a document, you can modify the major and minor revision data on the document.

You can change the revision scheme after a document has been published, skip revision numbers, and manually add a revision number, then have it validated against the revision scheme. It is not required to assign a minor revision number. Also, revision data from tools is supported even if the document has previously been revised in SmartPlant Foundation.

You can revise a document by using any previous revisions that are available from the last published revision.

**Example**

If you revise a new document using the revision scheme RevAlpha (A, B, C, D…) and revision C, then SmartPlant Foundation reserves revision number C for the document. Revising the same document with RevAlpha, you can now revise with any previous revision numbers, such as A or B. However, if the document is published to SmartPlant Foundation with revision number C, you are not allowed to go back to the previous revision numbers.

The following table contains the available revision numbers based on the document revision state in SmartPlant Foundation:

**Document revision state**

**Next available revision number**

Working (C)

C and up

550/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Current (C)

D and up

The combination of the major and minor revision values must be unique in the plant, or when working with As-Built, in the project.

When you check out or fetch a drawing from the As-Built into a project, only the last revision record is displayed in the **Revision History** dialog, regardless of whether that revision is associated with a version or not.

Deletion of revisions is allowed in a non-integrated environment. Deletion of revisions is also allowed in an integrated environment where revisions are managed by Smart P&ID, provided the revised drawing has not yet been published and regardless of any permission settings. Revision deletion is performed in the **Revision History** dialog.

**Publishing Documents**

In an integrated environment, you must publish documents containing the drawing data and relationships before the authoring tools can share this information. The publishing process involves selecting a document to publish, assigning it to a workflow (if necessary), and specifying a revision and version of the document if specified in SmartPlant Foundation. For most documents, the associated data is included in the publishing process.

The authoring tools publish data in XML format. The software then places the .XML file in the appropriate SmartPlant Foundation vault and loads the data from the .XML files to the SmartPlant Foundation database.

After the document is published, users can retrieve the data from the .XML file in the SmartPlant Foundation vault into other authoring tools.

When you publish documents, the software does the following things: Creates a new master document and the first revision in SmartPlant Foundation the first time you publish a particular document. From that point on, the software creates new versions and revisions when the document is subsequently published. The software relates revisions to the master document. You can publish subsequent revisions into a workflow, which can be a different workflow than assigned in the original publish. Changes in the document status of a related revision change the status of the subsequently published versions and revisions of the document.

Publishes a visual representation of the document that you can view without the authoring tool. For many applications, this is an Intergraph proprietary file, called a RAD file. The viewable file can also be an Excel spreadsheet or another viewable file type, such as .pdf or .doc. You can review and mark up the visual representation of the document, which is attached to the document revision, using SmartPlant Markup.

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Publishes associated data, depending on workflow approval. If the data is approved and loaded, it is used for reporting and subsequent retrieval by downstream applications when the tools retrieve latest data. The software publishes only meaningful engineering data. The published data is not enough to re-create the document in the originating tool.

Places the published .XML file and any view files in the appropriate SmartPlant Foundation vault. This

.XML file can be retrieved when users in the authoring tools retrieve as-published data.

Sends notification to the publishing tool.

For more information about revisions and versions, see Revisions and versions.

**Reasons to Publish**

You can publish documents and associated data for several reasons:

To exchange and enhance data among tools, to avoid creating data multiple times in multiple authoring tools

To report on common data originating in multiple tools

To provide enterprise-wide accessibility to published documents

To manage change, including workflow history and document revision management You can also publish documents to share information with users in other tools without going through a formal workflow. To share data, you can publish a document to a “for sharing” workflow that has only a load step, so that the data in loaded into SmartPlant Foundation as soon as you publish the document.

You can also publish a document by not assigning the document to a workflow, but rather by using the default workflow from SmartPlant Foundation. When you do not select a workflow for a document during publishing, the SmartPlant Loader Manager loads the document into SmartPlant Foundation as soon as it reaches the top of the Loader queue.

**Publishing Documents**

Each authoring tool publishes different documents and data. The following list contains each authoring tool that is part of integration, the document types that each tool publishes, and information about whether data is also published with each document type.

Plant Breakdown Structures (PBS)

Project Breakdown Structure

Project Definition Documents

Project Lists

Instrument Process Datasheets (IPD)

Equipment Lists

Instrument Master Lists

The PBS document published by SmartPlant Foundation contains information about the physical plant with a structure consisting of plants, areas, and units. The default structure is plant/area/unit, but you can define a custom hierarchy in the Schema Editor. When a PBS document is published from SmartPlant Foundation, the authoring tools are notified about the plant, areas, and units that need to be created in each authoring tool.

The project breakdown structure, project definition document, and project list contain information about projects and their statuses. When these documents are published from SmartPlant Foundation, the authoring tools are notified of projects and contracts that need to be created in the authoring tools.

The project breakdown structure contains a single project and the hierarchy of contracts under that project in a plant/project structure. The project definition document contains information for a single project that needs to be created in the authoring tool. The project list contains a list of all projects in a plant, and it is used by those authoring tools that create all projects at one time.

The plant breakdown structure and project breakdown structure used in the authoring tools must match the structure in SmartPlant Foundation for publishing from the authoring tools and object correlation to work correctly.

When you publish data from an authoring tool, you might not be able view all the properties that you published in the SmartPlant Foundation client. You can customize view definitions to allow you to see additional properties. For more information about defining view definitions in the SmartPlant schema, see Working with View Definitions and Create a View Definition in the Schema Editor User’s Guide.

For further assistance with visualizing data in SmartPlant Foundation, contact Intergraph Support Services.

When publishing from a project, an instruction container, which contains all the claimed objects, is created within the tombstone file.

**Publishing Files without Data**

You can also browse to and publish other file types, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or SmartSketch files. These documents are always published without data. The primary reason to publish documents without data is so that you can manage document changes and reviews using workflows and view the document electronically using the SmartPlant Foundation Change Management functionality.

**Publishing from Smart P&ID - Work Process**

- This step applies to a plant that is configured to use SmartPlant Foundation revisions. If your plant is configured to use Smart P&ID revisions, a new revision is added in the Smart P&ID **Revise** dialog.

For details of the revision procedure, see *Smart P&ID Drawing Manager Help*.

**Publish Documents from Smart P&ID**

Before you can publish a document for the first time, at least one revision of that document must exist. The software finds only those documents that have revisions. If a document has several revisions, the software finds the most recent revision of that document.

This functionality is available only if you have registered the active plant using the SmartPlant Registration Wizard. See Register from Smart Engineering Manager.

If you logged on to the authoring tool with a user name that is not defined in the integrated environment, you are prompted to log on when you use this command.

**Retrieving Documents**

When you retrieve documents into an authoring tool, you are retrieving the document data that was published by another authoring tool. For example, in Smart Instrumentation, you can retrieve engineering information from a published P&ID into the Smart Instrumentation database.

The authoring tools provide commands that let you select a document and retrieve it into that tool. You can use either the **Integration** > **Retrieve** command to open a wizard that assists you in retrieving applicable https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

documents, or with some authoring tools, you can configure an automatic retrieval feature.

When you publish a 3D model, you must now enable the **Scheduler** and **Loader** in SmartPlant Foundation to make the 3D model data document retrievable. The load, consolidate, and merge tasks must complete successfully before the 3D model document can be retrieved.

The software trims all leading and trailing spaces from all strings and from all values without units of measure. These spaces do not appear in the retrieved data file.

Additionally, you can access the Web Client through the **Integration** > **Browser** command. This allows you to select the document or documents that you want to retrieve from your Web Client To Do List, the tree view, or by using the Web Client search functionality. After you select the documents that you want to retrieve, you can use the **Retrieve** command on the Web Client **Integration** menu to start the retrieval process.

The **Retrieve** command provided in the authoring tools is slightly different from the **Retrieve** command available in the SmartPlant Foundation Web Client. The Web Client presents a list of documents from which you can select those you want to retrieve. However, when you use the command from an authoring tool without first selecting documents, the software searches the SmartPlant Foundation project for documents to retrieve, and these are presented in a list on the **Retrieve** dialog.

You can retrieve a document in two ways:

**As published**

Retrieves only the data the authoring tool originally published with the selected revision and version of the document. Retrieving as-published data retrieves the .XML file the authoring tool published from the appropriate SmartPlant Foundation vault.

**With the latest data**

Retrieves the latest data associated with the selected document in the SmartPlant Foundation database. If another, more-recently published document contains updates to objects in the selected document, the software retrieves the most current data in the SmartPlant Foundation database for those shared objects.

When you retrieve the latest data, SmartPlant Foundation generates an .XML file containing the published data.

**Document Types for Retrieval**

The types of documents that you can retrieve depend on the authoring tool you are using. The following lists include the documents that each authoring tool can retrieve:

**All Authoring Tools**

From the authoring tools, you can retrieve the plant breakdown structure (PBS) and project documents. The PBS and project documents, created in SmartPlant Foundation and published, are retrieved by authoring tools to provide information about the plants, areas, units, projects, and contracts that need to be created in the authoring tool so that the information is consistent across all authoring tools.

The PBS document published by SmartPlant Foundation contains information about the physical plant with a structure consisting of plants, areas, and units. The default structure is plant/area/unit, but you can define a custom hierarchy in the Schema Editor. The project breakdown structure, project list, and project definition document contain information about the project or projects and their statuses in a plant/project structure.

Retrieving the project breakdown documents and the PBS into Smart Engineering Manager creates the appropriate structures automatically.

When using Smart Instrumentation, you must create the plant hierarchy according to the PBS

information in SmartPlant Foundation before you retrieve either the PBS or the project definition document. You must create a plant hierarchy with at least three levels with a minimum of one unit before you can retrieve the PBS and project definition document.

When working in a project, retrieval is not available.

For certain document types, the tool schema definition can specify that To Do List tasks (Create, Update, or Delete) will not be generated for those document types. See Suppress Generation of Tasks

on Retrieve.

**Data Handling After Retrieval**

The authoring tool that you use also determines how the system deals with changes in downstream data when you retrieve a document. Smart P&ID, Smart Instrumentation, Smart Electrical, and Aspen Basic Engineering analyze the impact of the newly retrieved data on the existing database, and then place tasks on the authoring tool’s To Do List that allows you to modify items at the appropriate time in the design process. The To Do list gives you the opportunity to view and understand potential changes before accepting your changes. In Smart 3D, you can view the P&ID using the **View** > **P&ID** command to pull in the data and correlate items.

**Design Basis**

Objects that tools retrieve from other authoring tool documents can become the design basis for objects in downstream documents. Objects that become the design basis for other objects can be specific objects that get richer as they move through the life-cycle or can be schematic or logical objects in one application that evolve into more detailed objects downstream.

Design basis is implicit based on retrieval; you do not have to define it. For example, a pump retrieved from a PFD becomes the design basis for a pump in the P&ID. When you change common properties for the pump and retrieve the changes into Smart P&ID, tasks to update property values automatically appear in the To Do List. The same process works for logical items that are a design basis for other items, such as a stream in Aspen Basic Engineering that results in multiple pipe runs in Smart P&ID, or a P&ID tag in Smart P&ID can evolve into a control loop with associated tag numbers in Smart Instrumentation.

**Retrieving to Smart P&ID - Work Process**

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) documents, such as the Project List, Project Definition, and Project Breakdown, and Plant Breakdown Structure (PBS) documents are considered Administrative documents by the software and must be retrieved by all tools that subscribed to these types of documents.

So, even when these documents are new to the tools (have not been retrieved by the tool before), they are still listed in the **Documents to be retrieved only** list because they must be retrieved.

**Correlation**

Correlation can be defined as establishing a design basis for an item that has a separate representation in two tools. For example, an instrument can share a design basis between Smart P&ID and Smart Instrumentation; if data for that instrument is updated and published from one of the tools and then retrieved in the other tool, an Update task is generated for the correlated item.

In many cases, a one-to-one relationship exists between an item in an external application and an item or items in the drawing software. For example, a piece of equipment defined in Aspen Basic Engineering usually maps to a single equipment item in Smart P&ID. In these cases, after correlation has taken place, it is not possible to correlate the item in Smart P&ID with any other item in the external application unless the item is first uncorrelated. In addition, if an item that has a design basis is deleted and then published in the external application and afterwards retrieved in Smart P&ID, a Delete task will appear in the To Do List for the correlated item.

Correlation of the same item with different applications occurs independently.

For some types of piping, a single item in the external application is associated with multiple items within the drawing software. For example, a single stream item in Aspen Basic Engineering normally maps to multiple pipe runs in Smart P&ID. The **Correlate** command allows you to review and manage these relationships within the drawing environment.

**Automatic Correlation**

Automatic correlation takes place when you run a task in the To Do List for an item that does not have an existing design basis. This can occur in the following situations:

A newly-created item in the external application that does not have a matching item tag in Smart P&ID

is retrieved in Smart P&ID. This results in the generation of a Create task. When this Create task is run, the item is created in the Smart P&ID drawing and is automatically correlated with the item in the external application.

Automatic correlation does not take place for items that are initially created in the plant stockpile, such as loops. Such items must first be moved to the active drawing stockpile and then correlated manually.

An item in the external application that has a matching item tag in Smart P&ID and non-identical mapped properties is retrieved in Smart P&ID. This results in the generation of an Update task. When this Update task is run, the properties of the item are updated in Smart P&ID and the item is automatically correlated with the item in the external application.

**Manual Correlation**

Manual correlation is available on the To Do List for Create tasks only, and is allowed under the following conditions:

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

574/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

The selected item cannot have an existing design basis for the same tool from which the item was published.

The selected item must be of the same item type as the item for which the Create task applies.

If a catalog item exists for the selected item, its catalog item type must be the same as the catalog item type defined for the Create task.

For more information, see *Perform Manual Correlation*.

**Uncorrelating Items**

When a design basis exists for an item, the item can be uncorrelated in one of the following ways: On the To Do List, you can uncorrelate items from their Update or Delete tasks. See Uncorrelate Items

from the To Do List.

Using the **Integration** > **Uncorrelate** command, you can uncorrelate items even if they were not deleted or their properties were not changed in the external application. See Uncorrelate Items.

**Changing the Design Basis of an Item**

It is not possible to directly change the design basis of an item; however, this can be achieved by first uncorrelating the item and then performing manual correlation between the required items. The uncorrelate step makes the item on the drawing or in the active drawing stockpile available for manual correlation with a suitable item in the external application. Where the uncorrelate step is performed on an Update task on the To Do List, that task is permanently removed from the To Do List. The next time the document is retrieved, the To Do List is updated and a Create task is generated for the item, allowing you to correlate the item in the external application with a new item in Smart P&ID (by running the Create task) or with an existing Smart P&ID item (by performing manual correlation for the Create task).

Update tasks only update those mapped properties that are *different* in the two tools. When changing the design basis of an item that includes uncorrelation of an Update task followed by manual correlation to a different Smart P&ID item, it is recommended that you retrieve the item again and run any new Update tasks that are generated so as to synchronize the item’s properties.

**Correlate Pipe Runs with Streams**

This procedure explains how to correlate pipe runs in Smart P&ID with Aspen Basic Engineering streams. A single stream item in Aspen Basic Engineering normally maps to multiple pipe runs in Smart P&ID.

1. On the main menu, select **Integration** > **Correlate**.
2. In the drawing, select either an item that was retrieved and placed in the drawing or a previously correlated item. As you move your pointer over an item in the drawing that is already correlated, the item is highlighted. When you select a correlated item, it is added to the **Items** list on the **Correlate** https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

dialog as a primary item. Then the application searches the database for all other items that are correlated to the same design basis item and adds them to the list as well.

1. On the **Correlate** dialog, select **Add**.
2. Select an item in the drawing that you want to correlate with the retrieved item. When the **Correlate** dialog opens, you can highlight and select only items that were retrieved or native P&ID items that are already correlated. Because retrieved items already have a correlation, a message appears to make sure that you want to change the existing correlation.

When you retrieve a document into Smart P&ID, each item that is created in a stockpile is automatically correlated to the design basis item that it came from.

**Remove the Correlation Between Pipe Runs and Streams**

1. Select **Integration** > Correlate to display the Correlate Dialog.
2. Select the item in the **Items** list whose correlation with the design basis you want to remove.
3. Select **Remove**.

**Correlate Command**

Opens the Correlate Dialog and allows you to review and edit the correlation between plant items and

design basis items.

**Correlate Dialog**

Allows you to review and edit the relationship between plant items and design basis items imported from external applications.

**Items**

Lists all the items associated with a single design basis item. Items in the active drawing are displayed in bold font style. A single item can be selected from the list, and when selected, the item is highlighted in the drawing.

**Select**

Allows you to review a different drawing item. Selecting this button clears the **Items** list. As you move your pointer over an item in the drawing that is already correlated, the item is highlighted. When you select on a correlated item, it is added to the **Items** list as a primary item.

Allows you to correlate an additional item to the same design basis item that the listed items are already correlated to. This command is available only when one or more items already appear in the **Items** list. As you move your pointer over an item in the drawing that has the same item type as the items in the list, the drawing item is highlighted. When you select on a highlighted item, it is correlated with the same design basis item, and it is added to the list. If you select an item that is already correlated to some other design basis item, a confirmation message appears. If you correlate a new item with a previously correlated item, both are associated with the same design basis item; however, the new item inherits the properties of the item that it is correlated to rather than the design basis item.

**Remove**

Deletes the selected item from the **Items** list and cancels its correlation with the design basis item.

**Uncorrelate Items**

The purpose of this procedure is to uncorrelate drawing items with their design basis items.

1. Select one or more items on the drawing.
2. On the main menu, select **Integration** > Uncorrelate to display the Uncorrelate Dialog.

In the **Design basis details** pane, beside the **ID**, **Item Tag** and **Item Type Name** columns, the software displays additional columns for each of the tools for which a design basis exists for the selected drawing items.

1. Select the check boxes for the items that you want to uncorrelate for each tool. To uncorrelate all of the items in a particular tool that have a design basis, select the check box in the header for that tool.

If an item does not have a design basis for a particular tool, the cell is read-only and it is not possible to select the check box.

After uncorrelating an item, any relevant tasks for that item on the **To Do List** dialog are removed.

**Uncorrelate Command**

Opens the Uncorrelate Dialog and allows you to review and remove the correlation between plant items and design basis items.

**Uncorrelate Dialog**

Allows you to review and remove relationships between plant items and design basis items retrieved from external applications.

**Design basis details**

Lists all the items selected on the drawing that have a design basis.

**ID**

Displays the SP_ID that uniquely defines the design basis of the item.

**Item Tag**

Displays the item tag as defined in Smart P&ID, if one exists.

**Item Type Name**

Displays the item type name, for example, **Equipment: Mechanical**.

For each tool for which a design basis exists for the selected items, the tool name appears in the additional table columns. Each cell in the column has a check box that is initially not selected. To remove an item’s design basis for a particular tool, select the check box in the individual cell corresponding to the item and the tool. To uncorrelate all of the items in a particular tool that have a design basis, select the check box in the header for that tool.

If an item does not have a design basis for a particular tool, the cell is read-only and it is not possible to select the check box.

**Using the To Do List**

The To Do List allows you to keep track of tasks required to keep P&IDs updated with information in the SmartPlant Foundation database. Specifically, this feature aids in retrieving data by providing a list of all the things that must be added, deleted, or modified to bring the drawing into agreement with the newest retrieved information.

A single To Do List is shared by all the users of a plant database. You can view the entire To Do List and see the tasks that have been completed and those that are pending. Some types of tasks have associated code and you can run them thereby causing the database or drawings to be modified.

From the To Do List, you can run, defer, or delete tasks, or specify tasks that you want the software to ignore in future retrievals. Additionally, you can view properties for each task in the To Do List and, if required, specify that certain task properties are ignored when the task is retrieved. The information that is available is specific to the type of task that is selected: Create tasks and Update tasks, for instance, but certain information is provided for all types. The available task types are: **Create**

Creates a new item in the active drawing or the plant stockpile

**Update**

Updates the selected properties of the specified item

**Delete**

Deletes the specified item from the plant

**Manual**

Creates and displays a reminder. You can decide when a manual task is complete and set the status accordingly.

Each task in the To Do List has a status. Initially, the status is **Open**. If you successfully run the task, the status changes to **Complete** . If you attempt to run a task, but the process is not completed successfully, the status is changed to **Error** . **Error** status occurs, for example, if you attempt to run an Update task assigned to a drawing that is not currently open. For a Create task where the task runs successfully, but the software has made changes to the item tag, the status is updated to **Completed with Warning** . For more details, see . You can also postpone running a task and change its status to **Deferred** .

Smart P&ID retrieves equipment components and nozzles and generates corresponding Create tasks in the To Do List for them. The system allows you to automatically place the items in a drawing when the To Do List task is executed. The items are placed attached to their parent equipment item, based on a spacing algorithm. You can adjust the location, post-placement, as necessary.

When the software creates an Update task in the To Do List, the units of measure used in properties are automatically converted to the defaults for the plant. The units of measure used for properties in Create tasks are converted to the plant defaults when the task is run.

By clicking the heading of columns on the To Do List, you sort the list by the values in that column.

You can change the order in which these columns appear in the **Task List** by right-clicking a column heading and choosing either **Shift Left** or **Shift Right** from the shortcut menu to move the column one place in either direction.

**Open the To Do List**

On the main menu, select **Integration** > **To Do List**.

**Open a Drawing from the To Do List**

1. On the main menu, select **Integration** > **To Do List**.

**Run Tasks from the To Do List**

1. Select **Integration** > **To Do List**.
2. On the **To Do List** dialog, select one or more tasks to run.
3. Select **Run** .

If a task is assigned to a drawing, the drawing must be open before you can run the task. You can open a drawing from the **To Do List**.

Manually created tasks are not executable tasks and cannot be run from the **To Do List**.

**Example of ‘Completed with Warning’ Status**

This status appears for Create tasks when the software has performed a validation and determines that an item with the same tag sequence number already exists. In such cases, the new item automatically receives a new sequence number, and the To Do List item status becomes **Completed with Warning**, indicated by the icon . The following scenario shows how a Create task can receive this status.

1. In Smart Instrumentation, create a loop named ‘c-114’ and publish the Instrument Index.
2. Retrieve the Index in Smart P&ID.
3. Open the To Do List to verify that a Create task exists for the loop, but do not run the task.
4. Close the To Do List and then manually create a loop named c-114.
5. Reopen the To Do List and execute the loop create task.

The software will create the loop, but actually renames it. In the To Do List, the Create task for the loop appears with a **Completed with Warning** status icon as shown.

**Perform Manual Correlation**

This procedure explains how to correlate an item where the Smart P&ID item tag does not match the item tag in the external application. Manual correlation is allowed under the following conditions: The selected item cannot have an existing design basis for the same tool from which the item was published.

The selected item must be of the same item type as the item for which the Create task applies.

If a catalog item exists for the selected item, its catalog item type must be the same as the catalog item type defined for the Create task.

1. Select **Integration** > To Do List to display the To Do List Dialog.
2. Select the Create task that you want to correlate.
3. On the toolbar, select **Correlate** . The software highlights items that are suitable for correlation on the drawing sheet.

Selection of an item for correlation is only possible from the main **Engineering Data Editor** window; you cannot perform correlation on an item if it is selected in an **Engineering Data Editor** view that was opened in the **Design** window.

1. At the message prompt, confirm that you want to correlate the selected item by selecting **Yes**. The Create task changes to an Update task and the software removes any properties on the task that have the same values as those of the item selected on the drawing sheet.
2. Run the correlated task to update the drawing item properties.

**Uncorrelate Items from the To Do List**

You cannot perform Correlate or Uncorrelate to items in the To Do List that were upgraded from versions prior to SmartPlant Instrumentation 2013. Republish the To Do List to allow the correlation functionality to work with items that were upgraded from versions prior to SmartPlant Instrumentation 2013.

1. Select **Integration** > To Do List to display the To Do List Dialog.
2. Select one or more Update or Delete tasks that you want to uncorrelate.
3. On the toolbar, select **Uncorrelate** .
4. At the message prompt, confirm that you want to uncorrelate the selected item by selecting **Yes**.

After uncorrelating tasks, the items will no longer be correlated with the tool from which those tasks were retrieved. The tasks are permanently removed from the To Do List and do not appear on the deleted tasks list. The next time the document is retrieved, the To Do List is updated.

**Ignore Task Properties**

1. Select **Integration** > To Do List to display the To Do List Dialog.
2. Select the Create or Update task whose properties you want to ignore.
3. On the toolbar, select **Properties**

**To Do List Command**

Opens the **To Do List** window, which lists tasks to be performed in the authoring tool (Smart Instrumentation, Smart Electrical, or Smart P&ID). From the To Do List, you can run, defer, or delete tasks, and you can organize your tasks.

This command is available regardless of whether a drawing is open or not.

**To Do List Dialog**

Provides the ability to manage tasks that need to be run within a Smart P&ID database to keep the plant current with information in the SmartPlant Foundation database. This dialog opens when you select **Integration** > **To Do List** on the main menu bar. The commands associated with the To Do List are all on the **To Do List** toolbar.

**Open Drawing**

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Opens the drawing associated with the selected task. If the drawing is not active, this command activates it.

Any currently-open drawings remain open. This command is available when a drawing-specific task is selected and the drawing is not currently open or active. If multiple tasks are selected, this command is available only if they are assigned to the same drawing. You can assign or reassign a **Create** task, but **Update** and **Delete** tasks that are already assigned to a drawing cannot be reassigned.

**Zoom In**

Centers and zooms in on the drawing items associated with the selected tasks in the Drawing view. You select the tasks from the list. This command allows you to visually inspect the referenced objects in the context of the surrounding drawing and is available when the selected task is associated with graphics and the drawing that contains the object is open and active. If multiple tasks are selected, this command is available only if each of the tasks meets these criteria.

**New Manual Task**

Displays the** Task Properties** dialog, and allows you to manually create a new task.

**Properties**

Displays the** Task Properties **dialog for the selected task. This dialog shows the detailed properties of the task. This command is available only when a single task is selected.

**Assign Drawing**

Creates an association between the selected task and a particular drawing. The **Assign Drawing** dialog opens and lists the available drawings. This command is available when you select manually added tasks or tasks resulting from the **Create** command. If multiple tasks are selected, this command is available only if each of the tasks meets these criteria.

**Create in Drawing**

When a Create task is run, the toggle state of this button determines where the item is created. If this button is *not* depressed (the default setting), the item created by running the selected task is sent to the Active Drawing stockpile. If the button is depressed, the item created is placed on the active drawing. If the catalog item of the task is an assembly, the item created can only be sent to the Active Drawing stockpile, and therefore in this case the toggle state of the button is ignored.

**Run**

Runs the task that you select from the list. This command is available when an executable task is selected, the associated drawing is open and active, and the status of the selected task is **Open** or **Error**. This command is not available for manually created tasks; in other words, the command is only available for tasks generated automatically by integration and importing data. If multiple tasks are selected, this command is available only if each of the tasks meets these criteria.

When a task runs, the status of the task and the **Run Date** and **Run By** properties are updated. If the task runs successfully, the status is updated to **Completed** . If there is a problem, the status is updated to **Error** . For a Create task where the task runs successfully, but the software has made changes to the item tag, the status is updated to **Completed with Warning** . See Example of ’Completed

with Warning’ Status. When the status is **Error** or **Completed with Warning**, a timestamp and error message are added to the **Notes** area on the **General** tab of the **Task Properties** dialog.

**Defer**

Toggles the status of the selected tasks between **Open** and **Deferred** . This command is available only when the selected tasks have **Open**, **Error** , or **Deferred** status.

**Delete**

Deletes the selected task from the **To Do List**. This command is available only when one or more tasks are selected. A confirmation dialog appears to verify deletion of the selected task or tasks.

**Ignore**

Allows you to specify the selected task from the To Do List as an ignored task. This command is available only when one or more tasks are selected. When you invoke this command, the software moves all the selected tasks to the ignored tasks list. An ignored task is skipped for all subsequent retrieve operations. To make a task available for running again the next time you retrieve data, you must delete that task from the ignored tasks list.

**Correlate**

Allows you to correlate tasks manually when a retrieved item tag does not match the defined correlation criteria. This command is available only when a Create task is selected. To correlate an item, you select a suitable item on the drawing sheet or in the **Engineering Data Editor**. After correlation, the Create task changes to an Update task and the software removes any properties on the task that have the same values as those of the item selected on the drawing sheet.

Correlation is allowed under the following conditions:

The selected item cannot have an existing design basis for the same tool from which the item was published.

The selected item must be of the same item type as the item for which the Create task applies.

If a catalog item exists for the selected item, its catalog item type must be the same as the catalog item type defined for the Create task.

**Uncorrelate**

Allows you to uncorrelate tasks related to items on the drawing sheet or in the **Engineering Data Editor**.

This command is available only when Update or Delete tasks are selected. After uncorrelating tasks, the https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

items will no longer be correlated with the tool from which those tasks were retrieved. The tasks are permanently removed from the To Do List and do not appear on the deleted tasks list. The next time the document is retrieved, the To Do List is updated.

**View Deleted Tasks**

Toggles the view between the To Do List and the deleted tasks list. To completely delete tasks, you select them from the deleted tasks list and select **Delete**

.

**View Ignored Tasks**

Toggles the view between the To Do List and the ignored tasks list. To make tasks available for running again the next time you retrieve data, you select them from the ignored tasks list and select **Delete**

.

**Report**

Opens Microsoft Excel and runs a report on the contents of the **To Do List**. This command is only available from the **To Do List** toolbar, but the report template, called To Do List.xls, produces reports much the same way other reports are produced.

**Filter / Sort Tasks**

Opens a dialog that allows you to filter or sort the list of tasks by the headings in the To Do List. This is useful if, for example, you want to filter or sort the tasks to run tasks of one type only, such as **Create** tasks.

**Refresh**

Updates the information that is displayed in the **To Do List**. Because only one **To Do List** is generated per plant, multiple users can be working in the **To Do List** at the same time, and so the information can change at any time. You can use the **Refresh** command to stay up-to-date.

**Group Related Tasks**

When this button is depressed, selecting the column header not only sorts the tasks based on the selected sort key but also groups the related tasks. If the **Group Related Items** button is not depressed, then selecting the column header only sorts the tasks based on the selected column sort key.

**Search box**

Allows you to display tasks using search-as-you-type for all data columns. During a search operation, the Search box is highlighted with a red border. If a filter is already applied on the To Do List, the search is performed on the filtered view. Only tasks for which data matches the search string are displayed; the rest of the tasks are hidden. The total number of displayed tasks is shown in the To Do List status area at the bottom. Search strings are *not* case-sensitive and cells in the Task List that include matching data are highlighted:

To clear the search string, select

**Comparison of Smart P&ID with PDS 2D**

There are many functions that can be compared between Smart P&ID and the PDS product. They include attributes and properties, code lists and select lists, relationships between placed items, construction status values, consistency checking and propagation, design file differences, and using filters.

**Code Lists and Select Lists**

In PDS, an attribute that is restricted to pre-defined values is said to be code-listed. These values for Smart P&ID properties are called select-listed values; they reside in a select list. See Comparing Code Lists and

Select Lists.

**Grouping Equipment in Smart P&ID**

With PDS™ 2D, before you place an equipment group, you must identify the equipment group before adding equipment components to a piece of equipment. With Smart P&ID whenever you place a component on a piece of equipment, the software automatically creates a group relationship among the equipment and its components. See Grouping Equipment in Smart P&ID.

**Setting Construction Status**

In PDS 2D, you set the construction status by selecting the **New**, **Future**, or **Existing** buttons on the **Construction Status** control. When an item is placed, the default construction status is **New**. In Smart P&ID, you can set construction status before or after you place an item. See Setting Construction Status.

**Comparing Consistency Check to Propagation**

Consistency Check in Smart P&ID serves the same purpose as propagation in PDS 2D. See Comparing

Consistency Check to Propagation.

**Comparing Graphics and Text in PDS 2D and Smart P&ID**

In PDS 2D, graphics are called cells. These graphics include pumps, tanks, piping, valves, and other items.

In Smart P&ID, graphics are called catalog items. See Comparing Graphics and Text in PDS 2D and Smart

P&ID.

**Using Filters and Display Sets Versus Levels**

PDS 2D uses levels to separate data types in the Drawing view. Smart P&ID uses filters and display sets to show certain parts of the drawing, such as only the equipment or only the piping, and you can combine filters in both display sets and compound filters.

**Comparing Code Lists and Select Lists**

In PDS, an attribute that is restricted to pre-defined values is said to be code-listed; that is, the accepted values for the attribute are defined in a codelist.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

605/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

When you add an entry to a codelist, the system automatically assigns a number for the entry. The value assigned will be greater than 10,000.

In Smart P&ID, some properties are likewise restricted to preset values. These values for Smart P&ID

properties are called select-listed values; they reside in a select list. See Data Dictionary Manager Help.

Some code lists and select lists contain special, restricted values, frequently in the **Short Value** entry.

These special values help Smart P&ID communicate information to other applications, such as PDS 3D, Smart 3D, and Smart Reference Data. Consequently, you should use caution when modifying any entries already included with the product when it is delivered to you. You must have special permissions, granted in Smart Engineering Manager, to modify select lists in Data Dictionary Manager.

**Grouping Equipment in Smart P&ID**

With PDS™ 2D, before you place an equipment group, you must identify the equipment group before adding equipment components to a piece of equipment. Moving components from one equipment group to another also requires that you manually regroup components so that they belong to the destination equipment.

With Smart P&ID whenever you place a component on a piece of equipment, the software automatically creates a group relationship among the equipment and its components. This guideline also exists for placing equipment labels and equipment component labels.

**Setting Construction Status**

In PDS 2D, you set the construction status by selecting the **New**, **Future**, or **Existing** buttons on the **Construction Status** control. When you place an item, the default construction status is **New**.

In Smart P&ID, you can set construction status before or after you place an item: If you know the construction status before placing an item, select **Tools** > **Options**, and then set the status on the **Placement** tab. All items that are subsequently placed in the drawing are assigned this status.

If you have already placed an item, select the item in the drawing and change the status in the **Properties** window.

**Comparing Consistency Check to Propagation**

Consistency Check in Smart P&ID serves the same purpose as propagation in PDS 2D. However, instead of waiting to check for errors until after the drawing is complete, Smart P&ID continuously checks for design errors during drawing creation.

Consistency checking is an important function in producing a useful design. The designer places the elements that compose the overall configuration of the design in a graphical mode. The designer places equipment, routes lines between equipment, places components on lines, and adds labels for accuracy.

https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

606/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

After the designer completes this work, consistency checking confirms that the created drawing agrees, or is consistent, with the design practices of the associated plant.

PDS 2D uses a process called propagation to verify the suitability of a design. Propagation determines that a drawing is not ambiguous. Also, the process populates the associated database if serious propagation errors do not exist. Propagation produces a report with propagation exceptions. You must resolve them for an acceptable drawing. Available tools can help in the review of the report along with the drawing. However, pinpointing the source of the inconsistency could require time. Also, when you discover an error, tools or suggested error recoveries are not available.

In the Smart P&ID environment, Consistency Check continuously blends into the software product, more so than the workflow associated with propagation. Consistency Check starts when you place or modify an item.

Smart P&ID uses predefined rules to establish relationships that verify the design, and it automatically reports in the graphical view on junctions that do not follow these rules.

To check for errors in your design, PDS 2D uses propagation, while Smart P&ID uses consistency checking.

Errors occur when you violate the design practices for a plant. For example, an inconsistency occurs if a designated material is connected to a different type of material.

In PDS 2D, propagation checks for errors each time the software populates the database. You can list the types of errors you want to detect, such as pipe and valve conflicts. The software detects and reports the errors so you can correct them in the drawing. However, because you do not receive a list of possible solutions, resolution can be time-consuming.

In Smart P&ID, consistency checking occurs continuously as you place equipment, route lines, and label items, according to settings in Smart P&ID Rule Manager. Double-click an inconsistency in a Drawing view, and the **Consistency Check** dialog lists solutions to fix the errors.

**Comparing System Editing to Propagation**

Smart P&ID is a data-centric application that makes use of a live connection to the plant database within the graphical environment. The drawing provides a familiar user interface for creating and modifying the data in the database. The database is the master data-store. The drawings can be re- generated from the data in the database.

PDS 2D is a drawing-centric application that can load the plant database from the data in the drawings.

Drawings can be created independently and loaded into the database at a later time. The drawings contain the master data. The database can be regenerated from the data in the drawings.

The term propagation as used in PDS 2D describes the process by which the data in the drawings are loaded into the database. This process includes three major parts: 1) Validation of the graphics, 2) Validation of the data and the spreading of the data through the network of connected items, 3) Loading of the database.

Validation of the graphics, validation of the data and loading of the database are not included in Smart P&ID

System Editing (propagation). **System Editing** is not a post-process of any kind. It is not driven by the https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

existence of labels on the drawing. It does not apply a precedence algorithm to determine the property value for each item.

It is a process that happens every time a property is changed (if the command is turned on). It is a process by which a property value can be spread throughout a connected network of items without requiring the user to visit each item. It is a process by which consistency can be maintained with minimal effort as the design changes.

See System Editing.

**Comparing Graphics and Text in PDS 2D and Smart P&ID**

In PDS 2D, graphics are called cells. These graphics include pumps, tanks, piping, valves, and other items.

PDS 2D cells are grouped together in libraries. You can add and delete cells or place cells from a library into the design file.

In PDS 2D, you can record text on a label. Then, at certain times, you propagate or write the information on the labels to the database.

In Smart P&ID, graphics are called catalog items. Smart P&ID supplies a pre-loaded set of symbols. Plant administrators can create more symbols if needed. See Catalog Manager Help.

In Smart P&ID, labels play a different role than in PDS 2D. In Smart P&ID, you add or edit properties information for each item in the **Properties** window, and the software continuously writes this information to the database. Most labels show item properties, which are stored in the database. These labels are referred to as “driven,” because they are updated as the property values of the item are updated. Smart P&ID also provides “driving” labels, which you can use to directly edit properties in the database by editing the properties of the label.

**Using Filters and Display Sets Versus Levels**

PDS 2D uses levels to separate data types in the Drawing view. The software automatically defines levels for the various parts of process systems. You can customize these levels, and you can combine them to view collective data sets.

In Smart P&ID, display sets show certain parts of the drawing, such as only the equipment or only the piping. A display set consists of one or more filters. For example, you can define a display set that combines a filter that displays 6- inch pipe with a filter that displays tanks more than 5 feet in diameter. Then, both 6-inch pipe and tanks over 5 feet in diameter are displayed.

Smart P&ID filters fall into the following categories:

Plant filters

Personal filters

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

Plant filters are stored in Plant Folders, and personal filters are stored in My Folders. The plant administrator defines Plant filters, while each individual user defines personal filters. You can use filters along with rules to check for errors in certain filtered views. Smart P&ID offers extensive flexibility in creating and editing filters. You can even edit the individual properties of the filters.

Although both Smart P&ID and PDS describe the same plant, a one-to-one correspondence between the components in the two models does not always exist. Smart P&ID to PDS piping data transfer is essentially the transfer of data from the Smart P&ID segment table to the PDS piping segment table, pdtable_12_xx.

The conceptual definition of a segment is the same in both applications, however that does not mean that there is a one-to-one correspondence between these two tables. For example, the number of segments is not the same, even if the Smart P&ID and PDS piping model exactly match from a design point of view. This situation is caused by the different drafting practices of Smart P&ID and PDS. For example, drains are shown as macro symbols on the Smart P&ID drawing. However, drains are branch segments in the PDS

model. Also, process connections to instruments are recorded as instrument signal lines in the Smart P&ID

database, but on the PDS side, process connections are piping segments.

Due to these differences, the data transfer process requires establishing a logical link between the corresponding segments. This linkage can either be in the form of interactive input from the PDS designer, who can choose a piping segment in a drawing by selecting it, or be a combination of attributes defined as unique criteria in the SPTransferOpt file. For more information on attribute mapping, see Mapping Attributes.

**Data Transfer in the Real World**

When you model a new line in PDS, use the **Data from P&ID** option, and then select a Smart P&ID

segment. By doing this, you are establishing the logical link. After this link is established, future data transfers can be fully automated.

However, as with most plants, there is a time when Smart P&ID drafting and PDS modeling continues in parallel. The P&IDs are changing while piping modeling continues in PDS. When the designer models a particular pipeline, the equivalent Smart P&ID segments might not yet exist in the Smart P&ID database, creating a significant amount of piping that does not have the associative link between Smart P&ID and PDS. This is just one example of how creating and updating links is an ongoing process rather than a one-time effort. For more information about maintaining links between Smart P&ID and PDS, see Creating and

Maintaining Links.

**Creating and Maintaining Links**

Understanding the Smart P&ID to Piping Data Transfer process during PDS project execution helps you make the most of the benefits offered by this feature. Careful use of the procedures in this document, combined with delta training for piping designers and other personnel, produces considerable time savings as opposed to manually checking P&ID against PDS piping data. If you would like to use this feature but need help, Intergraph Process, Power & Marine offers consulting services to guide you. For more information, see the **Customer Support** links on the **About Smart P&ID** dialog.

The key factor in these benefits is creating and maintaining links between the Smart P&ID and the PDS

segments. The following flowchart shows the workflow for resolving data transfer discrepancies during the plant design.

**PDS Design Considerations**

Use the **Data from P&ID** command often while routing new piping in PDS.

When creating a pipeline by copying existing piping, use the **Revise Attribute** > **Update from P&ID**

command to load the data from Smart P&ID.

When creating a branch using an existing segment or pipe, check whether the branch is shown in Smart P&ID. If it is shown, then use the **Revise Attribute** > **Update from P&ID** command to load the data from Smart P&ID.

Verify that the **Partial P&ID Data Transfer** option at the end of the **Segment Attribute** list is selected.

You can change this value by using the **Revise Attribute** command. Default transfer modes are set such that during a partial transfer all diameter- independent properties are transferred. This option allows the drain to share the line sequence number, pressure, temperature, and so forth, with the header and still have a different diameter and line number label. This action is controlled in the SPMap.mdb file.

Instrument connections or drains on equipment with no equivalent segment in Smart P&ID, can be excluded from future comparison reports. Simply select the **Inhibit Future Transfer** option when you https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

review a comparison report error related to these segments.

**Synchronizing P&ID and Piping Data**

Synchronizing Smart P&ID and PDS piping data should be done only a few times during plant design. The best times to synchronize are when the majority of the P&IDs are completed, revised, or issued. This synchronization involves running a P&ID Segment Data Comparison Report and then resolving any discrepancies and helps to build the association between Smart P&ID and PDS that is then maintained throughout the plant lifetime.

This synchronization involves running a P&ID Segment Data Comparison Report and then resolving any discrepancies, and is outlined in the flowchart above.

**Running a Segment Data Comparison Report**

Running a Segment Data Comparison Report is the starting point on the flowchart. The results of this report depend on two key factors:

The matching criteria defined in the SPTransferOpt file in the plant directory. For more information,

see Map an Ignored Attribute or Map an Unmapped Attribute.

The **Compare Segment with Node Numbers/Compare All Segments** setting.

While running this report, the **Compare All Segments** setting should be used, and matching criteria should be node numbers.

Based on the availability of P&IDs during the initial piping design stage, the number of discrepancies can be very high on the first run. Our experience shows that a piping designer, who has good knowledge of the piping involved and the related P&ID, takes approximately two to four minutes to resolve a discrepancy.

Successive uses of this procedure should reduce the numbers of discrepancies. If plant design resources or time do not allow resolving all discrepancies, then you should consider alternative methods to running the Segment Data Comparison Report.

One alternative is to change the matching criteria. Matching criteria directs the software to establish associations between Smart P&ID and PDS piping segments based on the value of the attributes specified.

For example, the default criteria of node numbers means that node numbers for a PDS piping segment must match with a P&ID segment. If the Smart P&ID to PDS Piping Data Transfer has not been done for a piping segment, then no node number is defined for that segment. This situation generates a **Node** **Numbers Undefined only** discrepancy. If the majority of the piping falls under this category, then the number of discrepancies can be very high. To reduce this number, change the matching criteria to something other than node numbers. Typically, any of the individual properties of a line number label such as NPD, line sequence number, insulation purpose, and so forth, can be used. It is better to use as many properties as possible so that they form a unique combination. All properties specified as matching criteria should have some value assigned to them on both sides.

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Another alternative to running the comparison report is to specify segment search criteria. This method can be used if all instrument connections on equipment or drain lines not shown on the P&ID contain common attributes such as different fluid codes or prefixes to line sequence numbers, and so forth.

Another possibility is to use a range of diameters so that small diameter segments can be eliminated.

**Establish a Smart P&ID/PDS Link**

When setting up data transfer for multiple plants, if the PDS 3D and Smart P&ID plants have the same set of properties and the same intended mapping, then you can copy the SPMap.mdb file from one plant to another. The Attribute Mapper always verifies that the Smart P&ID site in the .mdb file is the same as the map for the selected PDS project. However, if you are not sure if the plants have the same set of properties, we recommend that you copy the delivered SPMap.mdb file from the PDSHELL\pid\ folder.

For a project where data transfer was set up to work with an earlier version of Smart P&ID, some attribute mappings have changed. You can use either the new SPMap.mdb file delivered in the PDSHELL\pid\ folder or follow the procedure mentioned for CR32693 in the PDS README file. Even if you are going to work with the default attribute mapping, you must start SmartPlant Attribute Mapper at least once. If necessary, you can back up the updated SPMap.mdb file, delete the changes, and copy a fresh SPMap.mdb to go through the mapping process again.

1. Copy \WIN32APP\INGR\PDSHELL\pid\SPMap.mdb and SPTransferOpt to the PDS project directory.

For projects created with version 6.4.1 or later, these files are copied automatically from the PDSHELL\pid folder at the time of project creation.

1. Go to **Start** > **Programs** > **PD_Shell** > **SP PID to PDS 3D** to display a list of available PDS projects.

The software reads the list of PDS projects from the PDS proj_file.

The Attribute Mapper does not honor any other variables defined in the pds.cmd file, such as RIS parameter file locations, and so forth.

1. Double-click the PDS project to use with Smart P&ID and locate the SmartPlantV4.ini file.

The SmartPlant Migrator for P&ID utility opens and shows the PDS attributes for the selected project.

The location of the SmartPlantV4.ini file must be specified using a complete UNC path. If path to this .ini file is mapped on a network drive and the mapped network drive path is used to locate it, this results in errors.

After a relationship between attributes is established, the SmartPlant Attribute Mapper opens. The link between the Smart P&ID plant and the PDS 3D project is established and updated automatically in the SPMap.mdb file. For the attribute mapper to run properly, the following path to Smart Engineering Manager must be added to the system PATH environment variable:

“..\..\SmartPlant\Engineering Manager\bin”

For more information about mapping attributes, see Map an Unmapped Attribute or Map an Ignored

Attribute.

**Revising Linked Models**

**Modification in Smart P&ID**

The Smart P&ID software generates node numbers during consistency checking. If existing segments on the P&ID are modified, then those node numbers might also be modified. This situation occurs when placing either a branch on an existing segment or a segment break, causing the link between Smart P&ID and PDS

to become outdated. In most cases, changes in Smart P&ID mean changes in the piping model. Resolving this type of discrepancy improves the integrity of the design data.

**Modification of a PDS Model**

Physical modification of segments with PDS commands such as **Move Piping**, **Move Vertex**, **Move** **Pipeline End**, and so forth, do not affect Smart P&ID to PDS Piping Data Transfer. All branch component placement commands break the segments and potentially lose links with Smart P&ID. While placing drain connections, which are not shown on P&IDs, it is better to use the **Revise Attributes** > **Load from P&ID**

command on the header segment before placing the drain connection or branch components. Then all three segments are linked with the proper segment in Smart P&ID. After creating the branch drain segment, make sure that the **P&ID to Piping Transfer** mode attribute is set to **Partial** for the branch segment. Transfers done after placing a drain require that you use the **Revise Attribute** command three times.

**Mapping Attributes**

Smart P&ID to Piping Data Transfer relies on an attribute map stored in a Microsoft Access database located in the PDS project folder. This map database file is named SPMap.mdb, and contains information about the Smart Plant P&ID site server and plant. The Attribute Mapper utility is used to manipulate this map database. The Attribute Mapper is started from a shortcut provided in the PD_Shell program group named **SP PID to PDS 3D**.

The Attribute Mapper utility maps, un-maps, or ignores attributes between PDS 3D and Smart P&ID. The Attribute Mapper interface is similar to Windows Explorer in that it displays a tree view on the left side and list view on the right side. Attributes for piping segment, piping component, and instrument tables from the PDS 3D design database are available to map with corresponding Smart P&ID tables, specifically the PipeRun, PipingComp and Instrument tables.

The tree view divides attributes into four categories based on map status: **Mapped**, **Unmapped**, **Ignored**, and **All**. For Smart P&ID to PDS 3D data transfer, the **Ignored** map status is the same as the **Unmapped** status.

**The Default Map**

PDS software includes a default map in the PDSHELL\pid folder. This map has a set of attributes that are pre-mapped with known Smart P&ID properties. When you create a new project using PDS software, this map is copied to the project folder. For older projects, the SPMap.mdb file should be manually copied from the PDSHELL\pid folder into the 3D project folder.

The default map is functionally equivalent to the pid_to_piping file used for PDS 2D to 3D data transfer with a few exceptions. For example, it is not necessary to map units because of the way units of measure information is stored. This applies to attributes like pressure and temperature. The SPTransferOpt file includes the three options that you can find at the bottom of the pid_to_piping file. For PDS 2D to PDS

3D data transfer, the mapper specifies the database attributes that are considered in order to perform the data transfer. By default, for PDS 2D transfer the mapper is mapping NodeA (piping attribute 67) and NodeB

(piping attribute 68). For Smart P&ID to PDS 3D data transfer, because there are no node numbers in Smart P&ID, the mapper is mapping piping attribute sppid_piperun_guid (piping attribute 78).

**Select Lists**

Select-listed Smart P&ID properties are transferred based on their text value instead of number. The Attribute Mapper creates a map of PDS codelist entries for every Smart P&ID select list used in the mapped properties.

For example, fluid code “P” is represented by the PDS 3D codelist entry 25 and by entry 35 in the Smart P&ID select list. When the fluid code property is transferred, the property value changes from 35 in the Smart P&ID database to attribute value 25 in the PDS Database. This functionality has removed the requirement of maintaining the same select list and codelist values in Smart P&ID and PDS 3D.

**Map an Ignored Attribute**

This procedure includes only the major steps involved in mapping an attribute. Refer to PDS Online Help or documentation for detailed instructions.

1. Open the **SmartPlant Migrator for P&ID** utility. See Establish a Smart P&ID/PDS Link.
2. Select the **Ignored** category.
3. Select the table in the tree view.
4. Select a PDS attribute in the list view.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **Partial** are transferred when you use the **Partial Data Transfer** toggle within PDS.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **Default** receive the default value, which you enter in the **Default** box, during partial data transfer.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **No Default** do not get a default value and do not get transferred during partial data transfer.

All **Mapped** properties are transferred during complete data transfer.

**Map an Unmapped Attribute**

This procedure includes only the major steps involved in mapping an attribute. Refer to PDS Online Help or documentation for detailed instructions.

1. Open the **SmartPlant Migrator for P&ID** utility. See Establish a Smart P&ID/PDS Link.
2. Expand the **Unmapped** category.

1. Select the table in the tree view.
2. Select a PDS attribute in the list view.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **Partial** are transferred when you use the **Partial Data Transfer** toggle within PDS.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **Default** receive the default value, which you enter in the **Default** box, during partial data transfer.

Properties mapped with the **Transfer Mode** option set to **No Default** do not get a default value and do not get transferred during partial data transfer.

All **Mapped** properties are transferred during complete data transfer.

**Segment Data Comparison Report**

The software compares segment data on the basis of the matching criteria defined in the SPTransferOpt correlation table. If no matching criteria are defined, the software compares segment data on the basis of the Smart P&ID node numbers that are common to both the Smart P&ID database and the PDS database, or the node numbers and line number labels, depending on what you specify using the available options.

The piping segment data is also compared on the basis of the **Complete** or **Partial** data transfer options.

If a match is found, each attribute value, as specified in the SPMap.mdb correlation table and filtered for either complete or partial data transfer, is compared with the corresponding property value in the Smart P&ID database. For any pair of corresponding attribute values that differ, the discrepancy is reported in the Segment Data Comparison Report.

This report includes a comparison of the flow direction for the PDS piping segment and the Smart P&ID

segment by using the P&ID node numbers. If no corresponding segment is found in the Smart P&ID

database for a PDS piping segment with valid matching criteria, an error is reported.

If the search mode is set to **END** in the SPTransferOpt file, the software compares all of the Smart P&ID

segments that have matching search criteria to the applicable PDS piping segment and uses the Smart P&ID segment that best matches the PDS piping segment for the comparison. Otherwise, the search mode is **FIRST**, and comparison is made with the first P&ID segment that has matching criteria.

The Segment Data Comparison Report also includes line sequence numbers.

Because the data comparisons are performed on the basis of the PDS piping segments, not all segments in the Smart P&ID database are checked for matches.

The software creates the following files in the same directory location as the processed model file: https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

**Matching Criteria**

PDS uses matching criteria to generate the Segment Data Comparison report. In order to compare segment records, the records must first be matched or correlated. Matching criteria defines the correlating attribute in the PDS 3D database. The default attribute map reserves the pid_index_no attribute for matching criteria.

This fact means that the Segment Data Comparison report compares piping segment attributes from the PDS and Smart P&ID databases if the pid_index_no in the PDS database matches the unique sp_id in the Smart P&ID database.

**Smart P&ID**

Consider the following points when planning for data transfer from a Smart P&ID plant to a PDS 3D project.

**Symbol Properties** — By default, PDS searches the piping specification based on predefined aabbcc codes. Smart P&ID symbols must have a property mapped to the aabbcc_code attribute in the PDS

database. The delivered Smart P&ID piping component symbols have a property called aabbcc_code, which can be viewed and edited in Catalog Manager. Any new symbols must have this value defined, either at symbol creation or later.

**Naming Conventions** — PDS 3D is not capable of handling spaces in the path names to any files.

Therefore, this PDS restriction also applies to P&IDs. While creating units and drawings in the Smart P&ID site, take care to avoid creating paths with spaces.

**Symbology** — Smart P&ID stores drawings in a format other than IGDS (MicroStation). These drawings are converted to IGDS format to display in PDS. By default, PDS and MicroStation use a black background, while Smart P&ID uses a white background. When converted to IGDS format, this difference can make some Smart P&ID graphics barely visible on the black background.

Consideration should be given to this fact while defining symbology within Smart P&ID plants. Smart P&ID symbology is defined in Options Manager.

Two methods exist to manipulate the display so that all of the graphics are clearly visible in their new format:

**Method 1**: Turn off the **Reference File** > **Use Color Table** setting under **User** > **User** **Preferences** > **Reference File** in PDS. This action displays the drawing using the active color scheme for the PDS model, rather than honoring the colors from Smart P&ID.

**Method 2**: Change the **Background** color of the piping model to a light color by using **Settings**

> Colors.
> 

**Additional Attributes** — If properties added to the Smart P&ID database need to be transferred to PDS, be careful to match attribute type and length on either side. The maximum string length supported by RIS / PDS 3D is 240 characters. If a property has an associated select list in Smart P&ID, then it should have a corresponding codelist in 3D. You must run the Attribute Mapper to map new properties if you want the data to transfer.

**Codelists and Select Lists** — Even though having the same number and sequence for entries within a codelist or select list is not required, for any mapped attributes, the PDS 3D codelist should have all entries from the Smart P&ID select list. If a new text entry is added to a Smart P&ID select list, the same text entry should be created in the corresponding PDS 3D codelist. The Attribute Mapper must be run after any such change.

**Layers and Drawing Filters** — PDS uses the concept of layers in a piping design to display selected elements of a drawing; whereas, Smart P&ID uses drawing filters. The ExportLayer.xlsx file defines https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

621/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

how the layers in PDS are related to the different drawing objects. The location of this Excel file is defined in Options Manager.

You can assign layer alphanumeric names to item types in order to assure that graphics appear in the designated layers in PDS. Items are named according to filters, which are defined in Filter Manager.

For more information, see the topics dealing with layers in the Smart P&ID Online Help.

**PDS 3D**

**Codelists** — A PDS 3D codelist can be a super set of a Smart P&ID select list. This means that a PDS code list can have extra entries not contained in the Smart P&ID select list because the data transfer works one way; that is, from Smart P&ID to PDS 3D.

**User Attributes** — Attributes can be created in PDS 3D independent of the Smart P&ID plant if data transfer is not required. If transfer is required, care should be taken when adding attributes. A Smart P&ID database does not distinguish between short and long integers. Any new integer property that is added to such a database must be created as a long integer in the PDS database.

**Load from P&ID Options**

Updates the active segment data based on information defined in the Smart P&ID. The system verifies the temperature and pressure service limits when loading segment data from the Smart P&ID database into an existing piping segment for which data was previously transferred.

**Complete Data Transfer Option**

Transfers all mapped attributes from the selected Smart P&ID segment into the active PDS segment data.

Attributes that are transferred are shown in yellow. Attributes that are not mapped are shown in black.

**Partial Data Transfer Option**

Transfers those mapped attributes that have the **Partial** option chosen during attribute mapping, from the selected Smart P&ID segment into active PDS segment data. Attributes that are transferred are shown in blue.

**Equipment and Nozzle Numbers Option**

Updates the active segment data from the Smart P&ID using the segment data attached to the specified Equipment/Nozzle ID.

**Name from P&ID Option**

Selects the piping or instrument component that you want to place by identifying a component in the Smart P&ID. If the selected instrument has a tag number that does not exist in the Piping Job Specification, the system displays the **Instrument Placement** dialog with both **Data From Reference Database** and **Data** **From User** options. Select the **Data from User** option, select the shape that you want, and enter the https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

dimensions that are required. This procedure allows the tag number and the properties that were mapped in the attribute map to transfer from the Smart P&ID database to the PDS database.

This mechanism also applies to piping specialties.

**Graphical P&ID Setup Command**

This command searches, selects, and displays the Smart P&ID within the PDS piping design environment.

This display enables the graphical transfer of piping segment data by snapping to graphics in the active P&ID. You can also specify a component name for placement by selecting a component in the P&ID.

For data transfer purposes, only one P&ID can be active. You can select a P&ID to display from the list of P&IDs extracted from the Smart P&ID database. The list of P&IDs is limited to P&IDs for the active unit number in the PDS piping model, or if the active unit number is undefined, then all P&IDs from the Smart P&ID database are listed in alphanumeric order by drawing number.

The **Graphical P&ID Setup** command checks for the existence of Smart P&ID data in the PDS project. If P&ID data is found, then PDS 2D starts the old software component to allow data transfer from P&ID. If the project is PDS 3D only, then the data transfer from Smart P&ID to PDS 3D starts.

You can use the following options to select the P&ID to display.

**P&ID Conversion Option**

Launches Smart P&ID automation to convert the selected P&ID from its native format to IGDS format. The converted drawing is placed in a temporary folder. The drawing is closed automatically upon exiting the design session.

**Units of Measure Option**

Converts SI units in Smart P&ID using unit-related codelists from the Standard Note library in PDS. Smart P&ID stores all properties with a unit of measure in SI units. For example, length is stored in meters regardless of your plant settings. The software then checks another property that determines how you want length values to appear. When a property represents a quantity based on units (for example, pressure, temperature, and so forth) data transfer looks at the active segment data, or type 63 settings, to determine the unit of measure to use. The SI value stored in the database is then converted using unit- related code lists from the Standard Note library.

**Code-listed Attributes Option**

Uses a codelist map to translate the codelisted attributes. The Attribute Mapper stores mapping of codelist numbers such that their text values match. Data transfer uses this codelist map to translate the codelisted attributes from the database to the PDS database.

If the Smart P&ID database participates in Workshare environment, then the P&ID list is a combination of the P&IDs owned and subscribed to (that is, published by remote location) by the site.

Use the LocalModelItemLookupTable.sql utility if your connected Workshare satellite experiences performance problems when transferring piping data from Smart P&ID to PDS. This script converts a satellite database view (namely, the T_ModelItemLookup) that references a host table into a local table, allowing the data transfer to proceed without using a DBLink. Smart P&ID uses the DBLink to fetch unique Long IDs from the Host when running from a connected Workshare satellite. If the performance of opening the PID file in PDS is an issue or if maintaining the correlation between Smart P&ID and PDS after the merge is not an issue, then you can run this script to change the lookup for the Long ID from a view to the host to a local query. This utility is delivered as an SQL script to the

..\SmartPlant\P&ID Workstation\bin folder and can be executed using any Oracle user interface, such as SQLPlus. Do not use this script if the transferred PDS data will be merged back into a host PDS

database because the Long IDs will not be unique at the host.

Because Smart P&ID databases are unit-dependent and PDS databases are design area-dependent, one PDS piping design area can include data from different Smart P&ID units. Consequently, you must specify the correct unit number in the active segment data prior to requesting a list of P&IDs from a Smart P&ID database.

**Select P&ID by Line ID Command**

This command specifies a line ID by identifying piping in the PDS piping model or by accepting the active line ID. The system determines the Smart P&ID (or list of P&IDs) from the line ID. It searches the Segment Table of the Smart P&ID database using the system-unique number for the drawing and the line ID for the segment. All P&ID segments belonging to the specified line ID are highlighted.

**Select P&ID Drawing by Nozzle Command**

This command specifies an equipment number and nozzle number by locating a component connected to a nozzle, by typing in an equipment number and nozzle number, or by placing a data point over a nozzle in a model. The system determines the Smart P&ID from the equipment number and nozzle number and data in the Smart P&ID database. All P&ID segments that have the same line ID as the segment connected to the active nozzle are highlighted.

Currently, only the first segment coming off the nozzle is highlighted, not the entire line.

**Review P&ID Drawing Details Command**

Displays information about a selected Smart P&ID in the active unit.

**P&ID Drawing Display Categories Command**

Displays Smart P&ID display categories. Categories that are currently displayed are highlighted on this dialog. Selecting a category toggles its setting. P&ID controls display and symbology through the use of https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

drawing filters. The P&ID graphics in the converted IGDS format are not organized into familiar categories such as piping, equipment, or instruments, instead the software displays MicroStation levels 1 through 63

as Smart P&ID drawing filters. Some of the categories are turned off automatically to hide blank label enclosures and inactive heat tracing graphics.

**Restore View of Piping Model Command**

Restores the PDS 3D model view in the window where the Smart P&ID is currently displayed.

**Disable Display of P&ID Drawing Command**

Closes the currently displayed Smart P&ID and restores the PDS 3D model view.

**Named Component Existence Report Command**

Compares the existence of user-specified named components between the PDS and the Smart P&ID

databases in batch mode on the basis of a user-defined list of lines and then generates a report of the results.

If a PDS 2D P&ID database exists, then it is used with the PDS model as the basis for comparison. If it does not exist, then the Smart P&ID database is used as the basis for comparison. As part of the report, the software includes the database that the comparison was based on. The comparison does not make use of either the P&ID drawing or the PDS piping model. Therefore, the order of components is not considered in the report.

A user-defined list, design area, or model is used to define those items that are included in the report. The user-defined list must have one line ID per line. Whether you create a list or use a design area or model, the list of line IDs used to perform the comparison is included in the report.

The comparison considers the entire pipe run in both the Smart P&ID database and the PDS database. If a line ID is used in multiple Smart P&ID or is included in multiple PDS models, the complete definition of all P&IDs or models is included in the report regardless of the line-ID option that is selected.

The following items are included in the comparison report:

The named components in the piping design database are included and are compared on the basis of the following data:

Tagged piping commodities are compared on the basis of their piping component number Piping specialties are compared on the basis of their piping component number Inline instruments are compared on the basis of their instrument component number Tagged piping commodities in the Smart P&ID database that have the following data are included: The **Commodity Code** flag is set to by system or by user and the commodity code is defined https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

The **Piping Component Number** is defined

Piping specialties in the Smart P&ID database are determined by those piping components that have the following data:

The **Commodity Code** flag is set by the user or is blank

The **Piping Component Number** is defined

Instruments in the Smart P&ID database are determined by the following criterion: Only those instruments that are applicable to the PDS 3D model, such as those requiring dimension definition in the RDB, as determined by an Instrument Correlation List The Instrument Correlation List, which is necessary to define the applicable instruments for transfer, is a user-defined ASCII file in the project folder and is named pid_instrument. With this list you can specify the inclusion or exclusion of Smart P&ID instruments on the basis of their aabb or aabbcc codes. You can include or exclude groups of instruments on the basis of the aabb code for that instrument by using the appropriate keyword, either **Include** or **Exclude**, followed by the aabb code. You can specify exceptions to the aabb codes on the basis of specific aabbcc codes so that you can exclude from an **Include** group, or you can add those entries to an **Exclude** group by adding the exceptions under the line containing the **Include** or **Exclude** statement.

The **!** character signifies a comment line in this ASCII file.

The following text represents the default Instrument Correlation List that defines the Smart P&ID

instruments that are applicable to the PDS 3D model. In this example, the aabb code represents a substring search of the aabbcc code.

**Troubleshooting**

Some common difficulties that you may encounter are listed here, along with possible solutions.

**No Projects on This Site**

On some systems, you receive the **No projects on this site** error when you try to connect to the Smart P&ID site server. As a workaround, you can edit the Microsoft Access file \projectname\project\SPMap.mdb directly and add a line in the connection table as follows:

**Project Number** is the PDS project name (case sensitive)

**MapPathName** is the complete UNC path to the Smart P&ID plant SPMap.mdb file located in the PDS

project directory

**IsThreeD** has to be selected

**SPSiteNode** is the UNC path to the SmartPlantV4.ini file

**SPProjectName** is the Smart P&ID plant name

Save changes made to the SPMap.mdb file, and run the **SP PID to PDS 3D** command again.

If a client computer experiences problems connecting to the project, remove the Intergraph SmartPlant Attribute Mapper and Smart P&ID Automation components using **Add/Remove Programs**.

Restart the computer and reinstall PD_Shell and Smart P&ID Integration Tools using the silent installation.

Be aware that for PDS users to set up the attribute map and perform data transfer, they must have permission to access the Smart P&ID server through Smart Engineering Manager.

**Display**

Start PD_Shell, and go to piping. Inside the PDS piping model but before using the **Graphical P&ID Setup** command, select one of the two methods below so that all of the P&ID items are clearly visible in order to display properly the converted P&ID within PDS:

**Method 1**: Turn off the **Reference File** > **Use Color Table** setting under **User** > **User Preferences** > **Reference File**. This action displays the drawing using the active color scheme for the PDS model, rather than honoring the colors from Smart P&ID.

**Method 2**: Change the **Background** color of the piping model to a lighter color by using **Settings** > **Colors**.

**Display by Unit Filter**

Run the **Graphical P&ID Setup** command as with PDS 2D, unless the unit is simply a filter. If not specified, all plant P&IDs are shown. Note that the P&ID Drawing Name is what you see on the data transfer dialogs, not the drawing number.

**Temperature/Pressure Units**

Select lines for pipe run and component data for the **Name from P&ID** option. For pipe run data, four sets of temperature/pressure values with units must be set in the Smart P&ID or you will receive an error about temperature/pressure limits. You can choose the **No Minimum T-P Data for Service Limits Verification** option in the PDS project data manager to prevent that error. When using this option, the lower range of the temperature/pressure values is not checked, thus allowing undefined values in PDS: -9999.

**Removing Software from a Silent Installation Configuration**

For a silent installation, when you accept the **Smart P&ID Integration Tools** option on the PDS component loader dialog, the following components are installed and the following folders created: Intergraph SmartPlant Attribute Mapper

Intergraph Smart P&ID Automation, including

..\Common Files\Intergraph\RAD (used by Smart P&ID and SmartSketch)

..\Common Files\Intergraph Shared\SmartPlant

..\SmartPlant

If you need to remove the components for the silent installation and have SmartSketch on the computer, remove SmartSketch and its associated components first. Continue by removing PD_Shell from the **PDS**

**remove product** utilities. This action prompts you to confirm deletio *n of*  the Intergraph SmartPlant Attribute Mapper. Select **Yes**, and confirm the deletion of all shared files.

This step does not delete Intergraph Smart P&ID Automation. To remove automation, go to **Add/Remove** **Programs**, select **Intergraph SPP&ID Automation** from the list, accept its deletion, and confirm deletion of all shared files. Then restart your computer.

Before re-installing any software in the client computer, delete the three folders specified above, and any files contained in them.

**Known Issues and Limitations**

The **Graphical P&ID Setup** command cannot convert and display a P&ID that has a space in the P&ID file path. Make sure the paths and filenames to the P&IDs have no spaces in them. You get the same result if you use a comma in the P&ID title.

When the P&ID plant hierarchy does not contain the **Unit** item, an error occurs when snapping to a piping segment or a component in the **PD_Design** environment.

You must define the **Option Code** property for a component in Smart P&ID if you are planning to use the **Name from P&ID** command for transferring any other component information. The implication is that your piping specifications must be created before drawing the P&IDs if you use this command for any data transfer.

You must dismiss the **Graphics Setup** menu after selecting the P&ID that you want to display.

Sometimes this form may be hidden, and you must dismiss it before you can transfer data from a pipeline.

Levels settings (that is, displays of drawing filters) are not saved for a Smart P&ID drawing. You must select the correct levels each time that you enter the drawing.

If you want to see the P&ID labels and line types correctly, you must map your P&ID fonts to proper MicroStation fonts in one of the .ini files. ISO Plus RDB fonts and borders.txt contain this information.

Also, the standard RDB Arial Narrow is mapped to a not-always-present MicroStation font and causes unreadable labels on the screen.

To return to the main drawing, select **File** > Close Auxiliary Graphics.

**Close Auxiliary Graphics Command**

Exits auxiliary graphics mode and returns to the main Smart P&ID drawing.

**Drawing Basic Elements**

An element is any line, circle, or other part of the drawing. The **Draw** toolbar on the left side of the drawing sheet contains most of the buttons that you can use to draw any type of basic geometric element—freeform shapes, lines, arcs, circles, and so forth.

You can place most basic elements with just a few clicks. For example, if you want to place a line, select **Line/Arc Continuous** on the **Draw** toolbar. Then, click two points to indicate where to start and finish the line. If you do not want to place another line, you can right-click to end the operation.

Right-clicking ends most operations in the software.

You can also place the line by clicking **Line/Arc Continuous** and then clicking and dragging the pointer.

When you release the mouse, the line appears on the drawing sheet. With this method, you drag the pointer as if it were a pen. You can draw most elements, such as rectangles, circles, and arcs, with this method, sometimes called mouse-down drawing. The mouse-down method is typically used to place most elements in conceptual sketching and modification.

If you want to place a precise line, click **Line/Arc Continuous**, type values into the ribbon that appears, and then press ENTER. You can then click on the drawing sheet to place the line. This method, sometimes https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

called mouse-up drawing, is typically used for precision placement and when you want to draw elements that are related to each other.

In some cases, you might want to click points on the drawing sheet and type values in the ribbon to place an element. For example, you can click **Line/Arc Continuous** and then type 3.0 in the **Length** box on the ribbon box and press ENTER to lock the length value.

When a line that is three inches long appears next to the pointer, you can click anywhere on the drawing sheet to indicate where to place one end of the line. Then, you move the line around and click again to set the line’s orientation angle.

If you do not like the results of what you drew, you can select **Undo** on the **Main** toolbar. If you want to repeat an action, select **Redo** on the **Main** toolbar.

**Drawing lines**

If you want to place a line, select Line/Arc Continuous command (or **Line**) on the **Draw** toolbar. Then, select a point on the drawing sheet to indicate where to start the line. Select a second point to indicate where to end the line. If you do not want to place another line, right-click to end the operation.

You can also place the line by selecting **Line/Arc Continuous (**or **Line**) and then selecting and dragging the pointer. When you release the mouse, the line appears on the drawing sheet.

If you want to place a precise line, you can select **Line/Arc Continuous** (or **Line**), type values into the ribbon that appears, and then press ENTER. You then select the drawing sheet to place the line.

You can also use a combination of selects and ribbon input to place the line. For example, you can type a line length in the ribbon box to lock the length value and then set the line’s orientation angle graphically. You can set the color and line type by selecting a style in the **Style** list box.

**Draw a line**

1. On the **Draw** toolbar, select Line/Arc Continuous command** ** or , depending on the application you are using to open the Line ribbon.
2. Select the point where you want the line to begin.
3. Select the point where you want the line to end. This action defines the length and rotation angle of the line.
4. Right-click to end the line or press ESC.

To draw a series of connected lines, select at the point where you want each line segment to end, and then right-click.

If you close the shape, the command restarts so you begin drawing again.

Instead of selecting to draw the end points, you can type values on the ribbon bar. You can also use a combination of graphic and ribbon input.

Instead of selecting several different points to draw a line, you can drag the pointer to draw a line.

If **Maintain Relationships** is set, the software places relationship handles. You can use relationships to make an end point of a line tangent or perpendicular to the key point or end point of another element.

When you use **Point On** in the **SmartSketch** dialog, you can draw a line tangent to two curved elements. First, select the curved element, then move the pointer through the tangent intent zone on the first element. Use the **SmartSketch** dialog options to establish a tangent relationship to the other element. If you do not use the tangent intent zone, the line connects to the elements, but is not tangent to them.

**Draw a point**

1. On the Draw toolbar, select Point command .
2. Select to place a point.

Instead of selecting to place the point, you can type values in the coordinate boxes on the ribbon.

You can also use a combination of graphic and ribbon bar input. The coordinate origin is located at the bottom left corner of the window.

When an element is highlighted, you can select to select it.

When you select an individual element, the following things happen: The element changes to the selection color. You can change the selection color using **Options** on the **Tools** menu.

The element’s handles are displayed. Handles are solid squares at significant positions on a selected element, such as end points and center points. Handles allow you to directly modify the element—

drag a handle to change the element’s shape. Although you can select more than one element at a time, only one element can have handles at a time.

The element’s important properties are displayed on a ribbon.

If the element is linked or embedded into the current document, selecting it allows you to double-click it for editing.

When you select multiple elements or grouped elements, they change to the selection color.

**Selecting multiple elements**

You can select more than one element at a time by selecting the **Select Tool** and then holding the SHIFT or CTRL key as you select the elements you want to select. Or, you can select the **Select Tool** and then drag the mouse to fence elements.

You can use the ribbon to select whether you want only elements completely enclosed by the fence to be selected or any element that is partly enclosed by the fence. Many manipulation commands, like delete, move, copy, and rotate, act upon all elements in the selection set.

**Selecting an element that overlaps other elements**

**QuickPick**

If you want to select an element that overlaps other elements, and you cannot highlight the element you want by moving the pointer over it, you can use a tool called **QuickPick**. To use it, hover the pointer over the exact intersection of the elements. When the software displays an ellipsis, or three small circles, by the pointer, you can left-select or right-click to display a small toolbar that shows the number of selectable elements. You can move the pointer over the numbers; and, when the element that you want highlights, you can select the corresponding number to select it.

Moving elements in small increments with the Nudge command on the **Change** toolbar.

You can also select the Scale command and the Rotate command on the **Change** toolbar to move elements.

Press ALT while selecting a drawing view.

**Using the Select tool**

To move an element, you must first select it with **Select Tool** on the **Draw** toolbar. You can drag the selected element to move it without changing its shape.

The element’s handles do not need to be displayed for you to move it. If they are displayed, and you want to move the element and not modify it, position the pointer so it is not over a handle.

You can move an element with precision if you use the relationship indicators.

When you modify a drawing, elements with maintained relationships automatically update to honor the relationship. For example, if you move an element that shares a maintained parallel relationship with another element, the other element moves as needed to remain parallel. If a line and an arc share a maintained tangent relationship, they remain tangent when either is modified.

**Moving elements by specifying precision points**

You can move a line that shares a tangent relationship with an arc if you select the line and select **Move** on the **Change** toolbar. As you move the line, the line moves without maintaining the relationship with the arc.

You can then specify a ‘from’ point and a ‘to’ point by selecting on the drawing sheet or by entering values in the ribbon. You can move any element by specifying precision points with **Move**.

You must move an element with the Select Tool to maintain its relationships.

Instead of using **Copy** on the ribbon to copy elements, you can hold down the CTRL key while you select to position the elements.

You can use the ribbon boxes to specify the “to” point. The values are relative distances along the x and y axes. You must select to specify to which quadrant you want to move or copy the selection set.

When you move or copy elements, the “to” point becomes the next “from” point.

The software maintains relationships within the select set if they are still applicable after you have moved or copied the elements.

You can use other view manipulation commands, such as **Zoom**, **Fit**, and **Pan**, while you are using **Move**.

When you finish manipulating the view, the software returns you to **Move** at the point where you left off.

**Move an element with the Select Tool**

1. On the **Draw** toolbar, select Select Tool** **.

**Labels**

Technical drawings often have many labels that display important information about the objects or elements in the document. There are two types of labels: text labels and SmartLabels.

Text labels are associated with an element or object. If you move the element or object, the text label moves with it. You can create text labels in a document by double-clicking an element or object. A text label appears near the element so that you can type text. The label appears at the location where the element is double-clicked, except for closed elements, such as a circle or rectangle. The label position on closed elements is the center of the element. When you enter the text that you want, the text label orients itself with the element.

Another kind of label, a SmartLabel, can be associated to an object or element’s text attributes. A SmartLabel is often distinguished by a question mark in the display.

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

A SmartLabel displays the attributes of the element or object as text in the document. You can drag SmartLabels from the **Symbol Explorer** into the current document. SmartLabels have an .sym extension.

As you change an element’s or object’s attributes in the **Attribute Viewer** or the **Properties** dialog, the SmartLabel’s text displays those changes.

If an element or object has no attributes, and you drag a SmartLabel to it, the element or object picks up the attributes of the SmartLabel. For example, you might want to assign attributes to a heat exchanger, such as pressure and material type. If the SmartLabel has the pressure and material type defined, and the heat exchanger does not, the SmartLabel’s pressure and material type are copied to the heat exchanger.

If an element already has existing attributes, a SmartLabel placed on the element displays the values for the existing attributes. For example, if the heat exchanger already has values for pressure and material type attributes, the values of those attributes are filled in for a SmartLabel placed on the heat exchanger.

Not all SmartLabels assume the text attributes of an element or object. Some SmartLabels contain shapes that grow automatically if you add text to the SmartLabel.

**Engineering Fonts**

The engineering fonts delivered with the software contain industry-specific fonts, special characters, and symbols that you can use to annotate engineering drawings. These fonts include degree symbols, diameter symbols, and other special characters and symbols that are not usually included in a typical word processing package.

Your choice of font should be based on the industry for which you are creating engineering drawings.

The software provides TrueType® fonts; with TrueType fonts, what you see on the screen is what appears on the printed page. The screen display of the document closely matches the printed document.

When you open a .dwg or .dgn document, the software provides a default mapping to determine which TrueType font will be assigned to which AutoCAD or MicroStation font. You can make changes to this mapping to define your own mapping. You can change the mapping with **Options** on the **Tools** menu. On the **Foreign Data** tab, you can select the appropriate **Options**.

Also refer to the Character Map Command.

**Drawing with Relationships**

**Using Relationships as You Draw**

You can use relationships to capture and remember your design intent as your sketch. You can make your drawings associative by applying those relationships - or you can sketch designs that do not use relationships.

**How relationships affect a drawing**

You can move and change an element that does not use relationships in various ways without affecting other parts of the design. For example, when no relationships exist between two lines, you can move and change each line without affecting the other.

When you modify a part of a drawing that has a relationship to another part of the drawing, the other part updates automatically. For example, if you apply a perpendicular relationship between the two lines and move one line, the other line moves with it. The software remembers the relationship between these two elements and always maintains the perpendicular relationship between the lines. You can manipulate either of the two lines and the software will move or modify the line automatically to maintain the relationship.

Applying and maintaining relationships in the design simplifies changes to the design later. In the following drawing, all the relationships were automatically established as the design took shape on the drawing sheet.

If you want to change the design, you simply modify one segment of it and all the relationships are maintained.

**Applying and maintaining relationships in SmartSketch**

You can place elements that are related to each other as you draw. First, you must set the Maintain Relationships command on the **Relationship** toolbar.

You can also set **Maintain Relationships** using the **Tools** menu.

Then, as you select commands on the **Draw** toolbar and place lines, arcs, and circles, you should watch the relationship indicators that appear by the pointer. When a relationship indicator appears by the pointer, you can select to apply that relationship to the element that you are drawing.

**Visualizing maintained relationships**

When you apply relationships, relationship handles appear on the related elements. The handles are symbols that show how elements are related. You can display or hide the relationship handles in your drawings by setting or clearing the Relationship Handles command on the **Tools** menu.

Parallel

Perpendicular

Lock

For example, the following four lines appear with relationship handles (A) turned off and with relationship handles (B) displayed.

**Applying relationships to existing geometry**

You can apply relationships to geometry after you place it with the buttons on the **Change** or **Relationship** toolbar, depending on the application that you are using. These buttons include parallel, tangent, connect, and so on. You can use relationships created with these buttons if you set **Maintain Relationships** on the **Change** or **Relationship to**olbar.

**Removing relationships**

You can quit using all the relationships that you have applied to the drawing if you clear **Maintain** **Relationships**. You can also remove individual relationships by selecting a relationship handle and deleting it. Clearing **Relationship Handles** on the **Tools** menu hides the handles, but the relationships are still maintained and used in the design.

**When to maintain relationships**

Maintaining relationships makes designing more productive and revisions much easier. However, relationships can slow drawing and changes on large data sets. You should decide whether to use relationships depending on the speed of your computer and the importance of easy revision.

For conceptual sketching and diagrams, you might want to use relationships by setting **Maintain** **Relationships**. This method allows you to quickly get your ideas on paper and revise them easily using direct modification and driving dimensions. The kinds of projects in which you might want to use relationships include mechanical concepts, architectural details, layouts, and schematic diagrams.

**When to design without relationships**

For more complex projects where you initially need to draw with precision, you should not use relationships in the document. You can then draw with precision by using the PinPoint tool and entering values on ribbons. You can still use relationships within symbols. The kinds of projects in which you might want to draw without relationships include multiple-view drawings, floor plans, maps, and detailed designs.

If you switch between using relationships and not using them while you draw, you can receive confusing results.

**Intent zones**

As you draw and modify elements, small quadrants called intent zones appear next to the pointer. The software uses intent zones to interpret your intentions as you draw. Intent zones allow you to draw and modify elements many ways using few commands. You do not need to select a different command for every type of element.

**How intent zones work**

When you select to begin drawing certain elements, the software divides the region around the selected position into intent zones. By moving the pointer into one of these intent zones on the way to your next select location, you can tell the software what you want to do next.

The last intent zone you move the pointer into is the active zone. To change the active intent zone, move the mouse pointer into the zone you want to use, and then move it to the position where you want to select next. You can change the size of the intent zones using the SmartSketch Settings command on the **Tools** menu.

**Drawing tangent or perpendicular arcs**

You can use intent zones to change the result of the Tangent Arc command. To draw an arc tangent to a line, first select a point on the line to place the first end point of the arc. Then move the pointer through the tangent intent zone and select to place the second end point of the arc.

If you want to draw a perpendicular arc instead, you can move the pointer back into the intent zone region and out through the perpendicular zone before selecting to place the second end point of the arc. The arc is then perpendicular to the line.

669/984

3/13/25, 10:41 AM

Hexagon Documentation Site Export

You can also use intent zones to define the arc direction.

**Drawing arcs by three points**

When you use the Arc by 3 Points command, intent zones allow you to input the three points in any order.

You can also use intent zones to change the arc direction.

**Drawing lines tangent or connected to curved elements**

Using intent zones with the Line/Arc Continuous command or **Line**, you can draw a line tangent to a circle or arc. Or you can draw a line that is connected to the circle or arc, but not tangent to it.

**Draw with relationships**

1. Set the **SmartSketch** options so that the software recognizes the relationships you want to use. You can set the options with the SmartSketch Settings command on the **Tools** menu.
2. On the **Draw** toolbar, select a drawing command.
3. Move the pointer around on the drawing sheet to find relationships.

**Sample Workflows**

**Draw a line connected to another line**

You can use relationships to connect an element you are drawing with an existing element. You can apply a connect relationship as you draw the lines, or draw the line without a connect relationship.

1. Select **Tools** > **SmartSketch Settings**.
2. On the **Relationships** tab, set **End Point**, and select **OK**.
3. On the **Draw** toolbar, select **Line/Arc Continuous** or , depending on the application you are using.
4. Move the pointer to the end of a line in the application window. The software displays the **End Point** relationship indicator at the pointer.

While the software displays the relationship indicator, select to place the first end point of the new line. This end point is connected to the end point of the previous line.

1. Select where you want to place the second end point of the new line.
2. The new line and the previous line have connected end points.

If **Maintain Relationships** on the **Tools** menu is set, the software places a connect relationship handle at the point where the two lines connect.

If you do not want to place a connect relationship, you can follow the same procedure with **Maintain Relationships** cleared. The end points of the two lines will still be exactly coincident when you draw them.

Relationship handles can be displayed or hidden with **Relationship Handles** on the **Tools** menu.

1. Move the pointer to make the dynamic line approximately horizontal.
2. When the horizontal relationship indicator is displayed at the pointer, select to place the second end point.

If **Maintain Relationships** on the **Tools** menu is set, the software places a horizontal relationship handle on the new line.

If you do not want to place a horizontal relationship, you can follow the same procedure with **Maintain** **Relationships** cleared. The line will still be exactly horizontal when you draw it.

**Case where a relationship is not maintained**

Relationships cannot be maintained in certain cases, as in the following example.

1. On the **Draw** toolbar, select **Arc by 3 Points** .
2. Select where you want the sweep of the arc to begin.
3. Move the pointer to a position where the software recognizes a point on the element relationship with a line on the drawing sheet.
4. When the **Point On** relationship indicator is displayed at the pointer, select to define the second input point for the arc.

1. Move the pointer past the line and select. The position of this input point defines it as the end of the sweep, making the point in the middle a key point that cannot have relationships. The software recognizes this, and does not maintain the point on element relationship.

If the third input point for the arc had been between the first two points, then it would have been interpreted as the arc midpoint, making the second input point one end of the arc sweep. In this case, the point would have been constrainable, and the software would have maintained the point on element relationship.

**Connect point while drawing a line**

**Drawing Precisely**

**Placing elements with a grid**

The grid and its grid lines allow you to place elements in the document by aligning them with the grid lines or nearest intersection of the grid lines. You can use the grid if you want the elements to line up at regular intervals in the document.

The grid is an invisible set of lines in the document. When you use the **View** > Grid Snap command,

elements always align with the grid lines or nearest intersection of the grid lines. You can view the grid by selecting **View** > Grid Display command. The grid lines do not print.

You can change the display of the grid from static to dynamic by setting options on the **View** tab of the **Options** dialog. You can also adjust the brightness of the grid display using the **View** > Grid Brightness command.

When you zoom in or out, the grid lines for a dynamic grid are generated dynamically. You can set dynamic grid lines to appear at fine, medium, or coarse levels. The grid lines appear at common major measurement increments. A dynamic grid displays index lines that intersect with the darker, solid grid lines.

A static grid displays solid grid lines that do not move as you zoom in or out. You can set up the increment settings on the View tab (Options dialog).

When you perform Step 3, a red crosshair will appear at the pointer showing where an element’s points are placed. Elements align with the grid lines or nearest intersection of the grid lines.

Grid snap does not work while you identify elements that are aligned along grid lines. To override this, press the ALT key while identifying these elements.

Relationship and alignment indicators override the grid snap. You can suppress the indicators by pressing ALT.

**Transforming Elements**

**Changing the Shape of an Element**

You can change the size, position, or orientation of an element with your pointer. When you select an element with the **Select Tool**, its handles are displayed at key positions.

You can change the shape of a selected element by dragging one of its handles. The first figure shows the effect of dragging an end point handle. The second figure shows the effect of dragging the mid-point handle.

**Modify an element with the Select Tool**

1. On the **Draw** toolbar, select Select Tool.
2. Select an element.
3. Position the pointer over one of the element’s handles. The pointer changes to show that the element can now be modified.
4. Drag the element handle to reposition it. You can use relationships to position the handle precisely.

To retain the angle or aspect ratio of the element you are modifying, hold the SHIFT key while you drag the element’s handle.

To suspend the effect of relationship handles so that you can modify the element more freely, hold the ALT key while you drag the handle. The software maintains relationships as appropriate for the modified element.

**Rotating symbols**

You can rotate a symbol by using one of the following methods:

Selecting **Rotate**.

Selecting the symbol’s rotate handle to turn it.

Using a rotation angle.

Using relationships applied to the symbol.

**Rotate button**

To rotate a symbol, you can select the symbol and select **Rotate** on the **Change** toolbar.

**Rotation angle**

You can also rotate a symbol by the rotation angle. When you drag a symbol or align it to an element, you can press the left or right arrow keys. This rotates the symbol in 15 degree increments by default. Some symbols are designed to rotate at different increments.

If the symbol is created with a rotation angle other than zero, you can rotate it by the defined step angle using the left and right arrow keys.

**Relationships**

By default, when you rotate a symbol, it maintains its orientation on the drawing sheet. In the following example, the line and symbol share a dimensional relationship. The lower end of the symbol is set in place with a lock relationship. When you edit the dimensional value of the driving dimension, the symbol does not change its orientation. The driving dimension changes to a driven dimension that is not to scale.

You can also allow symbols to change orientation on the drawing sheet according to the relationships applied to them. This is handy if you want to change the orientation of whole sets of geometry with one driving dimension or relationship. In the example, when you edit the driving dimension between the line and symbol, the symbol changes orientation on the drawing sheet, maintaining the relationships applied to it.

For a symbol to rotate according to the relationships applied to it, you must first set an option by opening the symbol document (.sym) directly. You can open the document with **Open** on the **File** menu. Then, you must select **Properties** on the **File** menu. On the **Behavior** tab, you must set the **Allow rotation by** **relationships** check box. After saving and closing the symbol document, you can drag the symbol into a document.

**Rotate an element**

1. Move the pointer until the mirror axis and the mirrored elements are in position where you want them to be, and then select.

If **Maintain Relationships** is set, the software places a symmetric relationship when you mirror and copy elements. The mirror axis is used as the symmetry axis.

Relationships within the selection set are copied to the mirrored elements if they are still applicable.

You can select **Mirror** before you select elements to mirror.

Instead of using **Copy** on the ribbon to mirror and copy, you can hold CTRL while you select to position the elements.

Instead of positioning the mirror axis dynamically, you can use the **Position Angle** box on the ribbon.

You can use relationship indicators to define a mirror axis.

You can use other view manipulation commands, such as **Zoom** and **Pan**, while you are using **Mirror**.

**Scaling Elements**

The Scale command on the **Change** toolbar reduces or enlarges selected elements by a scale factor that you define. The scale factor is the same along the x and y axes. Scalable elements include framed elements, such as text boxes. You cannot use **Scale** to scale or scale and copy elements in a drawing view because a scale factor has already been applied to the drawing view.

Relationships within the selection set are maintained if the relationships are still applicable after the elements have been scaled. If not, the relationships are deleted.

To define the new scale, you can select points on the drawing sheet or you can type a value in the **Scale** **Factor** box on the Scale ribbon. You can also use the **Step** box on the ribbon to make the **Scale Factor** increase or decrease incrementally as you move the mouse.

**Scale an element**

1. Select one or more elements.
2. On the **Change** toolbar, select the Scale command .
3. If you want to copy the scaled elements, select **Copy** on the Scale ribbon.

You can also select the Scale command on the **Change** toolbar to scale the drawing; the dimensions are scaled to compensate for the change in size. **Scale** changes the size of one set of geometry to another set of geometry in the document. To change the overall size of the graphics with respect to the paper size, use **Sheet Setup** on the File menu.

Relationships within the selection set are maintained if the relationships are still applicable after the elements have been scaled.

**Scale an inserted object back to its original model size**

When you insert an AutoCAD or MicroStation document into a drawing sheet using **Object** on the **Insert** menu, the object is automatically scaled to fit the print area of the drawing sheet. The print area size changes depending on the selected working sheet. In some cases, you might want to work in model space and not paper space.

1. Select the **Insert** > Object command to insert an AutoCAD or MicroStation object.
2. Highlight the inserted object with the **Select** tool.
3. On the shortcut menu, select Properties command (File menu).
4. On the **Info** tab of the **Properties** dialog, select **Scale (1:1)**. After you close the dialog, the inserted object changes back to the original model size.

If an inserted object was scaled before bringing it into the drawing sheet, you might need to adjust the scale on the **Properties** dialog to get the results you want.

After inserting an AutoCAD or MicroStation document, if you have not performed any other actions, you can select **Undo** on the **Edit** menu to change the object back to the original model size.

**Extending or trimming elements**

You can trim, extend or split/segment elements with buttons on the **Draw** toolbar. You can also add fillets or chamfers by selecting the Fillet command or the Chamfer command on the **Draw** toolbar.

Relationships are added or removed as necessary when you trim or extend an element. For example, if you trim part of a circle and more than one arc remains, concentric and equal relationships are applied between the remaining arcs.

You can also draw a chamfer on two different elements with **Chamfer** on the **Draw** toolbar. The elements must be linear, but do not have to intersect. The elements cannot be parallel to each other.

When two lines intersect, you can draw a chamfer simply by selecting the corner and then moving the pointer in the distance that you want. A final select on the drawing sheet places the chamfer (B).

To place a fillet, you can select **Fillet** on the **Draw** toolbar and then select the elements you want to modify.

As with any command, you can use a combination of selects and ribbon input.

**Extend an element**

1. On the **Draw** toolbar, select the Extend to Next command .
2. Do one of the following:

To extend one element at a time, select each element near the end you want to extend.

Before you select an element to trim, you can use **QuickPick** to see which portion of the element will be trimmed. When you move the pointer over the elements, **QuickPick** highlights the portion of the element that will be trimmed if you select.

If you trim an element that does not intersect any other elements, the command trims the entire element, effectively deleting the element.

**Draw a chamfer**

1. On the **Draw** toolbar, select the Chamfer command .
2. On the Chamfer ribbon, type a distance value in the **Setback A** box. The first linear element will be set back this distance from the corner.
3. Define the setback distance for the second linear element by entering a value in the **Setback B** box, or define the chamfer angle by entering a value in the **Angle** box, on the ribbon.
4. Select the linear element to which you want to apply the **Setback A** value.
5. Select the linear element to which you want to apply the **Setback B** value or the chamfer angle value.

The lines that you select do not need to intersect, but they cannot be parallel.

1. Select to draw the chamfer.

You can draw a chamfer only between linear elements.

When two lines intersect, you can draw a chamfer simply by selecting the corner and then moving the pointer in the distance that you want. A final select on the drawing sheet places the chamfer.

**Applying relationships to existing elements**

To apply relationships to elements that you have already placed on the drawing sheet, select a button on the Change Toolbar (in Catalog), or the Relationship toolbar and then select the elements you want to relate. When you apply a relationship between elements, the elements are modified to reflect the relationship. If **Maintain Relationships** is set when you use the commands on the **Change** or **Relationship** toolbar to add relationships to your drawing, the added relationships will be maintained.

For example, selecting **Equal** and selecting two circles makes the two circles equal in size.

If a line and arc are not tangential, applying a tangent relationship modifies one or both elements to make them tangent.

When you use commands on the **Change** or **Relationship** toolbar, the software allows you to select only elements that are valid input for that command. For example, when you use **Concentric**, the command allows you to select only circles, arcs, and ellipses.

Perhaps you begin designing with a few key design parameters. You would usually draw known elements in relation to one another and then draw additional elements to fill in the blanks.

As you draw and add elements to the drawing, the relationships are maintained, and additional relationships are applied.

**Modifying elements that share relationships**

If two elements share a relationship, the relationship is maintained when you modify either one of the elements. For example, if you move a circle that has a tangent relationship with a line, the line also moves.

The elements remain tangent.

If you move a circle that does not have a tangent relationship with a line, the line does not move.

Other elements that share relationships maintain them in the following ways: If a line and an arc share a tangent relationship, they remain tangent when either is modified.

If a line and arc share a connect relationship, they remain connected when either is modified.

If two lines are horizontal, they remain horizontal even if you change the position and length of one of the lines.

**Deleting relationships**

You can delete a relationship as you would delete any other element. You select a relationship handle, and then select **Delete**. Relationships are automatically deleted when their deletion is necessary to allow a modification to occur. For example, if you rotate an element that has a horizontal relationship applied to it, the relationship is automatically deleted.

If you want to change an element by adding or removing a relationship, and the element does not change the way you expect, it may be controlled by a driving dimension. You can toggle the dimension from driving to driven, and then make the change.

**Make elements concentric**

1. On the Change toolbar or Relationship toolbar, depending on the application you are using, select

Concentric command .

**Arranging Elements**

**Grouping elements**

A group is a set of elements that you have selected. The set behaves like any other select set. Grouping elements allows you to work with them as a unit. For example, you could place the holes and center lines of a bolt hole pattern into a group. This would allow you to move, copy, or delete the entire pattern at once, as if it were a single element.

The following list describes some of the properties of groups:

An element can be a member of only one group.

Grouped elements must reside in the same document and be on the same drawing sheet.

Any locatable element can be grouped.

Any combination of elements, such as lines, text, circles, and so forth, can be grouped.

You can use the Group command to nest two or more entire groups within a larger group, or you can nest

individual elements and groups within a larger group.

After elements are grouped, you can use the Ungroup command to ungroup all of the elements at the same time. You can also use **Ungroup** and **QuickPick** to remove one or more elements from a group.

**Selecting groups and members of groups**

The options on the **Select Tool** ribbon allow you to select an entire group or individual members of a group.

If you set the bottom-up option, you can select individual members. If you select the top down option, you can select all the members.

You can also use **QuickPick** to select one or more group members or an entire group.

**Performing tasks on groups**

After you select a group, you can use a command or ribbon option on all of its members. For example, when you move, copy, or delete a group, all of its members are moved, copied, or deleted. You can move or apply relationships to a member of a group and the changes do not affect the position of the other members of the group.

When you copy an entire group, all of its members are copied, including nested groups. The software creates a new group that contains all of the members of the original group. When you copy one member of a group, only that member is copied.

If you use **QuickPick** to select a member of a group, you can perform tasks on the member individually, without affecting other members.

**Element display priority**

When 2-D elements overlap, their display priority determines which is in front. The first element you draw is displayed behind all other elements—it has the lowest display priority. A newly created element is displayed in front of all other elements—it has the highest display priority.

For example, if you draw a circle, then an ellipse, and then a rectangle, the circle is displayed in back. The ellipse is displayed between the circle and the rectangle, and the rectangle is displayed in front.

**Changing the element display priority**

Using the Pull Up command and the Push Down command, you can change an element’s display priority by pulling it up one position, pushing it down one position, sending it to the back, or bringing it to the front. One select on the striped box changes the display priority.

You can change the display priority of a group the same way. The display priority of elements within the group does not change.

When you select a single element, the element moves to the back of the display.

When you send more than one element or an element group to the back of the display order, the elements retain their display order within the selection set or group.

**Bring an element to the front of the display order**

1. Select one or more elements.
2. On the **Change** toolbar, select the Bring to Front command** **.

2. On the **Change** toolbar, select the Push Down command .

When you push more than one element or an element group down one position in the display order, the elements retain their display order within the selection set or group.

**Managing Styles, Formats, and Colors**

**Applying unique formats**

At times, you may want to make geometric elements, dimensions, fills, or annotations look different from other ones on the drawing. To do this, you can edit the formats of the element directly. When you do this, the formats are applied only to the selected element or the one you are about to draw. This overrides whatever settings are applied to it by the style, without changing the style.

**Formatting individual elements**

Before you place or draw an element, you can set unique formats with the ribbon, without changing the style. The commands on the **Format** menu, except for **Style**, can also be used to set an element’s formats before you place or draw it.

For example, if you select **Text Box**, a style appears in the **Style** box on the ribbon. The style contains a format for bold fonts. If you turn **Bold** off on the ribbon, the text box that you place will not display bold text.

You can also apply unique formats to an existing element, dimension, fill, or annotation. You can select the element and then edit the formats with the ribbon or the **Edit** > **Properties** command.

For example, if you select a text box that has a style that displays borders, you can remove the borders with the **Edit** > **Properties** command. As you are changing the element’s format, and not its style, the style of the text box still contains borders. If you apply this style to any other text box, it will still display borders.

**Formatting more than one element**

You can change the format of more than one element at a time by selecting the elements and formatting them the same way you would format an individual element. However, all the elements that you select must be of the same type. For example, if you select several text boxes, you can apply settings to all of them at once. You cannot apply the same settings to a dimension and a text box by selecting both of them at once.

**Format a geometric element**

1. Select a geometric element, such as a line, arc, or circle.
2. Select **Edit** > Properties command.

You can also right-click the selected element, and select **Properties** on the shortcut menu.

After selecting the geometric element, you can use the ribbon to edit properties such as line style, line color, line type, and line width.

1. On the Element Properties dialog, set the options you want.

You can also format an element before you draw it by using the **Format** > Line command, or by

setting options on the ribbon.

Changing the current style settings on the ribbon or **Properties** dialog overrides the line style formats.

You can change the definition of a line style with the **Style** dialog.

**Format a Text Box**

1. Select a text box.
2. On the shortcut menu, select **Properties** **>**  **Text Box Properties** and then set the options you want.

You can format a text box before you place it by using the **Format** > Text Box command or by setting options on the ribbon. To apply several formats at once, select a style on the ribbon.

To format a group of text boxes quickly and easily, select several text boxes and apply a text style by selecting a style on the ribbon. You can modify a text style using the **Format** > **Style** command.

If you apply a text style, you can override the formats of the style by setting options on the ribbon or **Text Box Properties** dialog.

To apply a border to a text box, select a border option on the ribbon. To change the settings for the border, you must select the text and then, on the shortcut menu, select **Properties** to open the **Text** **Box Properties** dialog where you can set the options.

**Format a dimension or annotation**

1. Select a dimension or annotation.
2. On the shortcut menu, select **Properties**.
3. On the **Properties** dialog, set the options you want.

You can format a dimension or annotation before you place it by using the **Format** > Dimension

command, or by setting options on the ribbon.

You can also set formatting options on the **Dimension** ribbon.

You can also change a dimension style using the **Format** > Style command command. Dimension

styles apply to dimensions and all annotations, except text boxes and callouts.

If you want to format an existing balloon, you must select to select the leader line of the balloon, and then you can change the formats of the balloon.

**Applying colors and patterns to closed boundaries**

You can fill a boundary with a pattern or a solid color using the Fill command. Depending on the application, Fill displays on the **Label**, **Draw**, or **Text** toolbar. A fill is like other elements in that you can format it and move it around, but the fill is always associated with a boundary. The boundary can be made up of more than one element, but it must be closed on all sides. The following figure shows a pattern fill and solid fill.

The software provides styles for fills for various engineering standards, such as ANSI, ISO, and AIA.

**Modifying fills**

A fill is associative, which means it maintains its original orientation to an element regardless of the way you manipulate the element. For example, if you move the boundary, the fill moves with it. If you change the boundary, the fill changes to conform to the new boundary area.

A fill can exist only inside a closed boundary. If you drag a fill to another region, the fill assumes the shape of the region where you dragged it. If you open a closed boundary, the fill changes color to indicate that it is disabled. If you close the boundary again, the fill changes color to show that it is now active.

**Formatting fills in SmartSketch**

Formatting a fill is similar to applying formats to an element. You can apply unique formats to fills using **Properties** on the **Edit** menu or by setting options on the ribbon. To make several fills look the same, you can apply a fill style by selecting the style on the ribbon.

The blank color on the Fill ribbon takes on the background color of the document. This is useful for creating symbols that can cover an element on which the symbol is placed. Incorporating a fill with blank color into the symbol allows the symbol, when placed, to mask out elements such as lines or connectors that intersect the symbol.

You cannot modify an existing fill style, but you can create a new fill style by typing a new name in the **Style** box on the **Fill** ribbon. The new style uses the settings on the ribbon as the formats for the style.

If you want to copy a fill style from one document to another, just create a fill, apply a style, and then copy the fill to a new document. The fill style appears in a drop-down list on the **Fill** ribbon in the new document.

**Masking objects**

You can mask out underlying graphics without deleting or trimming by using the Mask command. The software provides a lot of flexibility for creating a mask, such as shape, line style, with or without a label or border. The following illustrations show examples of masks placed in a drawing. The first example shows a rectangular mask, border shown with dashed line style, with a caption.

You can place a fill only inside a closed boundary. If the software cannot determine the fill boundary due to the complexity of the geometry, the fill color will be gray to indicate that the fill was improperly done.

If the software determines that the fill boundary is not closed, the feedback is a beep and no fill.

1. Depending on the application you are using, on the **Label**, **Draw**, or **Text** toolbar, select the Fill

command .

1. On the Fill ribbon, select the settings that you want.
2. Select inside one or more closed boundaries that you want to fill.

If you open a closed boundary, the fill color changes to gray to indicate that it is disabled. If you close the boundary again, the fill changes color to show that it is now active.

When you change a filled boundary by drawing another element, the fill does not automatically update to fit the new boundary. You can refill the new boundary by selecting the fill handle, then selecting **Redo Fill** on the ribbon to apply the fill to the new boundary. You can also refill an area by dragging the handle to the new area.

To fill a boundary quickly, you can zoom in on it first using **Zoom Area** on the **View** menu.

Fills have limitations when using **Scaled Sketching** . See Draw a textured fill with Scaled Sketching.

**Format a fill**

1. Select a fill.
2. On the Fill ribbon, select the settings that you want to update the fill.

You can format a fill before you place it by setting options on the ribbon or using **Properties** on the **Edit** menu.

You can apply several formats at once by selecting a new fill style in the **Style** list box on the ribbon.

The blank color on the Fill ribbon (the cross hatched area at the bottom-right of the color-picker grid) takes on the background color of the document. This is useful for creating symbols that can cover an element on which the symbol is placed. Incorporating a fill with blank color into the symbol allows the symbol, when placed, to mask out elements such as lines or connectors that intersect the symbol.

**Create a fill color**

When you change a fill by setting options on the ribbon, you can create custom colors for the fill.

1. Select the Fill command.

The existing fill will be replaced by the pattern and color you select.

1. On the Fill ribbon, select **Solid Color** or **Pattern Color**.

**Pattern Color** will not be selectable when **Solid Color** is selected.

1. At the bottom of the palette, select **More**.
2. On the Colors Dialog, select **Define Custom Colors** and set the options you want to create a new color.
3. Select **Add to Custom Colors**.
4. On the Custom Color Name dialog, type the name that you want for the color you created. This name appears on the palettes for **Solid Color** or **Pattern Color** on the **Fill** ribbon.

**Refill a modified boundary**

When you change a filled boundary by drawing another element, the fill does not automatically update to fit the new boundary.

1. Select the fill handle inside the fill.
2. On the Fill ribbon, select **Redo Fill** to apply the fill to the new boundary.

Alternatively, you can also refill an area by dragging the fill handle to the new area.

If there is no possible intersection between the element you want to extend and any other element in the view, the command does not extend the element.

**Fill command**

Draw toolbar >

Places a fill inside a closed boundary. You can place a fill only inside a closed boundary. If the software cannot determine the fill boundary due to the complexity of the geometry, the fill color will be gray to indicate that the fill was improperly done. Also, if the software determines that the fill boundary is not closed, the feedback is a beep and no fill.

You can modify fill properties using the **Fill** ribbon.

**Pattern Color**

Applies a pattern line color for pattern fills. If you select none (the cross-hatched area at the bottom-right of the grid), the background will be transparent. Filled elements cover other elements when they overlap. You can select **More** to define custom colors with the Colors dialog.

**Solid Color**

Applies a system color to set the background color for the fill. If you select none (the cross-hatched area at the bottom-right of the grid), the pattern will be transparent. Filled elements cover other elements when they overlap. You can select **More** to define custom colors with the **Colors** dialog.

The blank fill color (the cross hatched area at the bottom-right of the color-picker grid for both the **Pattern Color** and the **Solid Color**) takes on the background color of the document. This is useful for creating symbols that can cover an element on which the symbol is placed. Incorporating a fill with blank color into the symbol allows the symbol, when placed, to mask out elements such as lines or connectors that intersect the symbol.

**Redo Fill**

Re-applies a fill to a filled area when the boundary changes. A fill can become disabled, and change color, if you modify its boundary by drawing another element or moving part of the existing boundary. If you select **Redo Fill**, the area surrounding the fill handle is filled again.

**Format Text Box dialog**

**Formatting a new drawing**

You can use styles to make new drawings conform to your company’s standards. For example, the software provides line styles with names such as **Normal**. You have decided to apply the **Normal** style to hidden lines. The **Normal** style has a line type that looks like a dashed line.

Your company standard may require that a hidden line look like a dotted line.

To change the **Normal** line style to conform to your company’s standards, you can follow these steps: 1. Select **Format** > **Style**.

1. On the **Style** dialog, select the line style type in the **Style Type** box.
2. In the **Styles** list box, select the **Normal** line style.
3. Select **Modify** to access the **Modify Line Style** dialog.
4. On the **General** tab, in the **Type** box, select the line type that looks like a dotted line.

All the lines that you draw while the **Normal** style is selected on the ribbon will conform to your company’s standards: hidden lines will appear as dotted lines. You can save the style to a template with **Style** on the **Format** menu. This allows you to use the style again in other drawings.

**Formatting an existing drawing**

You can use styles to make existing drawings conform to your company’s standards. Suppose you receive a drawing from another company, and all the hidden lines are continuous.

Your company standard indicates that hidden lines should be a line type that is dashed. You have been using a line style, called **Dashed**, to conform to the standards used by your company.

To change the hidden lines in the drawing quickly and efficiently, you can follow these steps: 1. Open the drawing that you received from the other company.

1. Select all the lines that you want to change.

**Copy**

Creates a copy of the element that you are rotating. If you do not want a copy of the rotated element, then clear this option.

**Step Angle**

Specifies the rotation step angle. The step angle specifies the increments, in degrees, that an element rotates from a temporary axis. The temporary axis is the line between the element’s center of rotation (A) and the point that you rotate the element from (B).

You can specify increments in the **Step Angle** box if you want to dynamically view the results of the rotation.

For example, if the box is set to 30.0, the rotation is displayed in 30 degree increments. The default setting is 0 degrees so that the rotation is fully dynamic.

**Rotation Angle**

Defines the rotation angle. The rotation angle is the angle between the point that you rotate from and the point that you rotate to. In the following picture, the center of rotation (A) is shown with the point that you https://docs.hexagonppm.com/internal/api/webapp/print/d8ef20bf-aedd-456c-8b70-f7bd82290220

rotate the element from (B).

The rotation angle (C) is the angle of change between the old and new positions of the rotated element. The value is always positive.

**Position Angle**

Displays the angle between the horizontal axis through the center of rotation (A) and the point that you rotate from (B). Then, if you rotate the element, the position angle (C) changes to become the angle between the horizontal axis and the point that you rotate to. The position angle is always a positive value that is measured counter-clockwise from the axis.

**Scale command**

**Scale ribbon**

**Scale ribbon**

Displays when you start the Scale command.

**Copy**

Scales and copies the elements in the selection set.

**Step**

Specifies the step value for the **Scale Factor**. The step value causes the **Scale Factor** to be decreased or increased in increments as you move the pointer toward or away from the scale origin. For example, if you set the step value to 0.25, the scale increases in increments of 0.25 as you move the pointer away from the scale origin.

**Scale Factor**

Specifies how much the software reduces or enlarges the element. A scale factor between zero and one reduces; a scale factor greater than one enlarges.

**Reference**

Specifies how long the dynamic line from the scale origin to the pointer has to be in order to achieve a Scale Factor of 1.

For example, if you set **Reference** to 1, for every inch you move the pointer away from the scale origin, the scale factor increases by one. If you set **Reference** to 2, for every two inches you move the pointer away from the scale origin, the scale factor increases by one.

**Slash**

**Size**

Sets the size of the terminator. The value is a ratio of the dimension text size. For example, if you set **Font** **Size** on the **Text** tab to be .2 cm and **Size** to be 2, the terminator is twice the size of the dimension text.

**Inside Limit**

Controls the terminator position relative to a dimension’s projection lines. The Inside Limit is calculated as a constant times the dimension font size. For example, if the font size is 0.125 inches and the Inside Limit is set to 3 (3 x font size), any dimension with a value *greater than or equal to*  0.375 inches positions its terminators on the inside of the projection lines. Any dimension with a value *less than* 0.375 inches positions its terminators on the outside of the projection lines.

**Display**

Specifies which end of the terminator displays or if both ends display. You can set the display to none (off), origin, measurement, or both origin and measurement. The following picture shows the display when you select **Origin** and **Measurement**.

**Freespace Type**

Sets the terminator type for a dimension with a terminator placed in free space.

**Origin Type**

Sets the terminator type used on the origin of a linear dimension.

This setting affects dimensions only at placement. You can change the terminator’s position after placement by dragging the terminator to the other side of the projection line.

In the example below, the inside limit value is 3, the font size is 0.1 in., and the dimension line is .317 in. in length. Therefore:

Dimension value > 3 (inside limit) * .01 (font size)

The inside limit affects newly-placed dimensions only. The setting has no effect if the dimension value is changed because of changes in the parent geometry.

**Datum Type**

Sets the terminator type for datum frames. If you select **Normal**, the datum frame uses the active terminator type for dimensions. If you select **Anchor**, the datum frame uses an anchor terminator.

**Symbol**

Sets options for symbols in dimensions.

**Placement**

Sets the placement position for the symbol on diameter and radial and linear dimensions for an arc. You can place the symbol before or after the dimension. You can also hide the symbol.

**Not to Scale**

Displays an underline, zigzag, or no indicator on driven dimensions with overridden values. You can use the zigzag option only on linear dimensions. You can override a driven dimension value by typing a new value in the **Edit Value** box on a dimension ribbon.

**Suppress Diameter**

Suppresses the diameter symbol on diameter dimensions.

**Circle ribbon**

**Tangent Arc command**

Draw toolbar >

Draws an arc tangent or perpendicular to one or two elements. The first point defines one end of the arc. If you place the first point on a key point of an element you want the arc to be tangent or perpendicular to, then the second point defines the sweep.

If you place the first point in free space, then this command works like **Arc by 3 Points**. In this case the first point defines an end point. You can then either define a point on the arc and then the end point, or the end point and then a point on the arc.

While in dynamics for the second point, you can set the orientation of the arc by passing the pointer through one of the four quadrants of the first point’s intent zone.

Sets the orientation of the text either horizontally or vertically.

**Units Space**

Sets the text box units to either paper units or to world units.

Paper units represent units on an actual sheet of paper. Paper units are set in inches. Other units are also available.

World units indicate real world distances but can be scaled down to fit a sheet of paper.

Within the drawing environment, “world units” is synonymous with the term “model units” found in other CAD packages.

**Justification**

Specifies the placement relationship between the origin and the shape (text box) according to the horizontal and vertical components.

The inside text area is an area that the margins of the text box define. That is, margins are inside the outside edges of the text box.

The following graphic illustrates top (1), right (2), bottom (3) and left (4) margins around the text box for horizontal justification (A) and vertical justification (B).

The maximum cap height of the first formatted text line of each line defines the text area capline, even if the line has been clipped out of the text box.

The line baseline is a font metric that describes an imaginary line for location of characters. The largest descender for any font on the line defines the baseline. Therefore, the largest descender of the fonts used on the last line defines the text area baseline, even if the line is clipped out of the text box.

The following graphic illustrates text cap area (a) and text baseline (b) for horizontal justification (A) and vertical justification (B).

This glossary is an assembly of pages with brief information about the standard symbols that are included with Smart P&ID.

Each page contains information about a different type or class or subclass of symbols and includes the symbol icons and the file name as well as other information that best suits the particular symbol library at hand. For instance, the label libraries contain information about the labeled item type and the label placement method, but the mechanical equipment library only contains information about the name of the symbol and the type of equipment.

The libraries are sequenced according to these broad classifications. If you are searching for a particular symbol, you can always use the **Search** tab of the Help viewer.

**Properties Glossary**

This glossary is intended to be a reference source for further information about the properties that belong to drawing objects. Item types and their properties are listed and related in this document.

If you encounter a property in the **Properties** window (or **Modify Item Type Properties** dialog in Data Dictionary Manager) that you want more information about, you can open the **Properties** node in the Table of Contents in this Properties Glossary. The properties are listed in alphabetical order.

Not every property that appears in the software is displayed directly in the **Properties** nodes of this glossary. For instance, Case properties (either **Control Case** or **Process Case**) apply to cases directly, which in turn are related to objects. For instance, if you are looking at an offline instrument, and you want to know more about the **Ctrl Case Min Voltage** property, this specific property does not appear in this glossary. However, you can look up the **Voltage Property** entry to obtain general information about voltage properties. The same principle applies for equipment items, for instance, whose properties include process cases. In order to determine if the property that you want to display information about is a case property, look in the categories in the **Properties** window. You must display a categorical view of the **Properties** window in order to see the categories, and you must display Case data, too. For more information about changing views of the **Properties** window in the Smart P&ID modeler, see Working with the Properties

Window in the *Smart P&ID Help*.

In Catalog Manager, all the case properties are automatically displayed. In Data Dictionary Manager, you have to select the **Complete list** option on the **Modify Item Type Properties** dialog in order to see all the Case properties.

The reason that this glossary does not list every property as it appears in the **Properties** window is that many of the properties there are actually “item attributions” and are properties that are constructed from the objects and properties in the database. Therefore, it does require extra work to discover their corresponding parts in this glossary.

The Data Model Excel spreadsheet is a two-dimensional representation of the application’s Data Model.

This spreadsheet lists item types, item properties, and data types, as well as all the constructed item attributions that apply to drawing objects. This list is alphabetical according to item type.
