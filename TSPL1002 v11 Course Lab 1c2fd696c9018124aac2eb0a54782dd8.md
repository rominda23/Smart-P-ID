1. For line **J**, select the pipe run.
2. In the **Properties** Window, select the **Fluid Code** field. * *

*Do any other connected lines highlight?*

**Note**:

- The connected line **L** should not highlight because the placement of the segment break will stop the copying of the fluid code property values performed by System Editing.
1. Select **Edit** > **Undo** to remove the End of Group segment break.
2. For line **J**, select in the fields for the following other properties, and make note of the properties that will copy or spread through the connected pipes because of System Editing.
- **Fluid Code**, **Insulation Purpose**, and **Piping Materials Class** will copy.
- **Tag Sequence Number** will copy across the reducer unless the line on the other side of the reducer already has a value defined for it. Also, it will copy into line **L** unless there is an existing inconsistency for **Tag Seq Number**.
- **Nominal Diameter** will not copy across the reducer, and will not copy into line **L** because a value is defined already. If a value for Nominal Diameter was not existing in line **L**, then the value would copy since the rule is to copy bi-directional if NULL.
1. Again, place the End of Group segment break on the end of line **L** where it connects to line **J**.

**Note**:

- The End of Group segment break stops the flow of several properties: Fluid Code, Fluid System, Insulation Purpose, Nominal Diameter, Piping Materials Class, Tag Seq No. Also, it suppresses the display of

inconsistencies for these properties.
